365,1,"how to dispose of yoga mats the vast majority of yoga mats are either made out of polyvinyl chloride (pvc), or thermoplastic elastomer (tpe). while these materials are theoretically recyclable, most yoga mats are manufactured with dyes and flame retardants that make them difficult for recycling plants to process. the sweat from your yoga sessions can also contaminate other recyclables it comes in contact with. since yoga mats are so durable, the best way to get rid of one is to donate it to a group in need or reuse it instead of throwing it in the trash.  donating your mat 1. clean your mat thoroughly before recycling, donating, or reusing it.¬†set your  out in a large sink or bathtub. squirt 1‚Äì2 tablespoons (15‚Äì30¬†ml) of dish soap directly on to the mat. grab a sponge or cloth and turn the cold water on. scrub every section of your mat thoroughly with soap and water before flipping it over and cleaning the other side. rinse all of the soap off before letting the mat air dry.  you must clean the mat regardless of whether you‚Äôre donating, recycling, or reusing it.  some yoga mats are machine-washable. look your yoga mat‚Äôs brand up online before machine-washing the mat. 2.¬†contact a local homeless shelter to see if they can use the mat.¬†look online to find contact information for homeless shelters in your area. call each shelter to see if they could use your yoga mat. homeless shelters often struggle to get funding and they can easily become overcrowded. most shelters will use yoga mats and other plush materials to make makeshift bedding in the event that a lot of people show up and they run out of regular beds. variation:¬†you may also be able to donate the mat to substance abuse clinics, orphanages, and other groups that service high-need communities. if the homeless shelters in your area aren‚Äôt taking yoga mats, don‚Äôt give up on trying to get it to someone in need 3. send your mats to a nonprofit organization that uses yoga to help people.¬†look online to see if there is a nonprofit in your area that could use your yoga mat. you‚Äôd be surprised by how many volunteer groups there are that teach yoga to prison inmates, children, and trauma survivors. since yoga encourages peace and positivity, many nonprofits use it as a vehicle to help people heal and grow.  there are a few big nonprofits that you can ship your yoga mat to. yoga activist works with social programs and government agencies to help at-risk communities learn yoga. off the mat into the world uses yoga outreach programs to promote social justice

611,1,"keeping my back straight / hamstrings i decided three days ago to take up yoga, and so far for the past three days i've done 30 - 45 mins of yin, holding poses for 10 - 15 breaths, or less if they're straining to me. i've found that i'm relatively flexible in some ways (can do the malasana squat pretty fine, the dragon too, the saddle...) but reaaally not in others. for example, i'm totally unable to reach my toes when standing straight with my legs together. i can only just get my hands past my knees, and that definitely hurts, i wouldn't hold it that long. also, if i'm sat on the ground and have to reach out to one or both outstretched legs in front of me, i can reach to my ankles but it hurts quite a bit, and my back is very curved. i would really like to work on my back straighteness when sat down with one or both legs outstretched, it's really difficult for me. i've been doing it by pressing my back against a wall to make sure it stays like that. i think it's my hamstrings, although i'm not certain. any ideas how long it would take to develop that back straightness / hamstring flexibility if i were to do 30 mins of yoga everyday? i want to keep up yoga because it merges several practises i want to make habits, and i can feel that it's good for my body and my mind. my logic in asking this question is that if i know what a realistic time scale would be for me develop some of that back straightness i may be able to be more patient and less hard on myself. any other advice is welcome too, i'm a total newbie ! once i can afford it i plan on going to a few classes so i'm sure i'm doing it right, as i imagine it's probably pretty easy to be doing a pose (an asana?) completely wrong and actually not getting the benefits of it.","keep my back straight / hamstring i decide three day ago to take up yoga, and so far for the past three day i've do 30 - 45 min of yin, hold pose for 10 - 15 breaths, or less if they're strain to me. i've found that i'm relatively flexible in some way (can do the malasana squat pretty fine, the dragon too, the saddle...) but reaaally not in others. for example, i'm totally unable to reach my toe when stand straight with my leg together. i can only just get my hand past my knees, and that definitely hurts, i wouldn't hold it that long. also, if i'm sat on the ground and have to reach out to one or both outstretched leg in front of me, i can reach to my ankle but it hurt quite a bit, and my back be very curved. i would really like to work on my back straighteness when sat down with one or both leg outstretched, it's really difficult for me. i've be do it by press my back against a wall to make sure it stay like that. i think it's my hamstrings, although i'm not certain. any idea how long it would take to develop that back straightness / hamstring flexibility if i be to do 30 min of yoga everyday? i want to keep up yoga because it merges several practises i want to make habits, and i can feel that it's good for my body and my mind. my logic in ask this question be that if i know what a realistic time scale would be for me develop some of that back straightness i may be able to be more patient and less hard on myself. any other advice be welcome too, i'm a total newbie ! once i can afford it i plan on go to a few class so i'm sure i'm do it right, a i imagine it's probably pretty easy to be do a pose (an asana?) completely wrong and actually not get the benefit of it.","straight / hamstring decide day ago yoga, far past day i've 30 - 45 min yin, hold pose 10 - 15 breaths, they're strain me. i've i'm relatively flexible way (can malasana squat pretty fine, dragon too, saddle...) reaaally others. example, i'm totally unable reach toe stand straight leg together. hand past knees, definitely hurts, wouldn't hold long. also, i'm sat ground reach outstretched leg me, reach ankle hurt bit, curved. like work straighteness sat leg outstretched, it's difficult me. i've press wall sure stay like that. think it's hamstrings, i'm certain. idea long develop straightness / hamstring flexibility 30 min yoga everyday? want yoga merges practises want habits, feel it's good body mind. logic ask question know realistic time scale develop straightness able patient hard myself. advice welcome too, i'm total newbie ! afford plan class i'm sure i'm right, imagine it's probably pretty easy pose (an asana?) completely wrong actually benefit it."

701,1,"why i think there will never be a yoga community without showing off difficult poses so, i had these thoughts surrounding achievements in yoga but also outside of it and i thought i'd share them here: i was just thinking about why yogis online tend to show these ultra-difficult poses and transitions in here as comp or also yoga teachers and influencers on instagram etc. which leads to a very distorted and intimidating view of yoga although yoga should be about your own journey and your own journey only, without comparison. and i realized why that's the case (apart from them just looking cool and being fun to play around with). i think there are two types of achievements and we tend to show only one of them to others. that is the visual achievement where i can say ""look what i can do"" (or also general for every achievement in life ""look what i did""). it's an easy way for us to show our achievement and success and get positive feedback for it because there is a factual component to it that people around us are able to grasp. the other type of achievement is the inner achievement. where we feel a difference in ourselves which is truly for us and for us only. they are often much more validating to us. in yoga they show as how we feel since we started our journey, how we feel during or after our practice but also how poses feel to us. an example would be a more solid warrior 2 where i can feel how the correct alignment unlocks so many benefits that make the pose so much more enjoyable, how i feel more confident with the pose over time, being able to hold it for longer without getting shaky, how i smile a little when the pose comes up because i want to be in the pose etc. but also outside of yoga sucu achievements can be how we grow happier with our job, have more balance in life, find the joy in little things etc. but the downside to these sorts of achievements is that we can't simply say ""look how i feel"". it simply is harder for the people around us to undersaltand these achievements, they can only listen to what we describe and trust us. and likewise, for us these achievements come slower, they aren't that sort of ""i did this pose for the first time today"" so there's no initial joy in it, it only is through reflection that we notice for example ""i did this pose already 200 times and it never felt as good as it does now"". which also leads to us keeping these achievements to ourselves and only notice them every now and then but there's no moment where we think ""look, look, i have to show you this"". of course that doesn't mean that the latter achievements are worth less, they are just less ""shareable"" with others but also online and there's less impulse to share them because they don't evoke such clear and sudden feelings in us. this basically made me realize how distorted the perception of achievements is, it really is like an iceberg. while we may have this achievement with that one pose we wanted to learn we have hundreds of other achievements in ouselves simultaneously that never come to the surface for others. but i don't think it's a bad thing. while yoga shouldn't be intimdating and comparison has no place in this beautiful practice, it's good to keep all those inner achievements to ourselves and only share them every now and then if we want to. because these achievements are meant for ourselves and our own inner world. and in the meantime, there's no harm in being proud of that new pose you finally nailed. thank you for reading. feel free to share your thoughts on this below, i'm curious to read

782,1,"predatory yoga instructors {trigger warning: sexual assault} hi, this is a difficult post to write but if it helps just one person out there it‚Äôs all worth it. recently i saw on the news that my former yoga instructor had been charged in court with molesting 5 students in classes. this triggered flashbacks. it started with those occasional brushes against sensitive areas in classes. he was a respected, popular instructor. i was just a beginner. i brushed them off as accidents or merely part of the adjustments. after all, this studio was known for providing extensive physical adjustments to its students. and these adjustments did in fact help me in my progress. then one day he told me he could help me work on poses i was weak at. i could drop by his place which was just a few stops from mine. guess what? i accepted his offer. i turned up at his place. it started like a normal personal training session. then the ‚Äúaccidental brushes‚Äù started. and then they became deliberate. i kept saying no and pushing him away. but he wouldn‚Äôt stop and eventually he pushed me onto his bed and assaulted me there. i felt my soul leave my body at that point. i was filled with guilt, humiliation and self-loathing for a long time afterwards. girls and guys, all i want to say is to please please trust your instincts. if a touch by your instructor makes you feel uncomfortable, please don‚Äôt second guess yourself. something is probably amiss. your instincts are there to protect you. anyway, under no circumstances should an instructor touch your privates, or touch you with theirs, during adjustments. and if they do so accidentally (and accidents do happen), they would apologize. this instructor never did apologize. yoga is supposed to be empowering, not degrading. i don‚Äôt wish for anyone to go through the same trauma. finally, if anyone has gone through something similar and needs someone to confide in, my dms are always open to you.","predatory yoga instructor {trigger warning: sexual assault} hi, this be a difficult post to write but if it help just one person out there it‚Äôs all worth it. recently i saw on the news that my former yoga instructor have be charge in court with molest 5 student in classes. this trigger flashbacks. it start with those occasional brush against sensitive area in classes. he be a respected, popular instructor. i be just a beginner. i brush them off a accident or merely part of the adjustments. after all, this studio be know for provide extensive physical adjustment to it students. and these adjustment do in fact help me in my progress. then one day he told me he could help me work on pose i be weak at. i could drop by his place which be just a few stop from mine. guess what?

that i have burned all the past karma that has been weighing on me for approximately 3 years i have to say something, i am not maitreya but his master, and i am in training for the role of the world teachers' human surrogate where in that role i will be essentially the spiritual guide from the resources of the human kingdom in a primary sense, because i possess all forms of god expression within the soul that i am. when you realize based on my writings here on reddit that what i say is true then you will know a big step that is necessary for you to take so that you can encourage yourself to improve for the sake of benefiting others socially economically and spiritually, because that is what is important. the maitreya that i refer to is the one from the writings of benjamin creme, a man who has since gone away but will return in a new body and mind with the same skillset and will inform the millions of people who are willing to receive his information which i will also assist in. before i go further, i will need to mention that this writing is primarily drawn from the intuition of me, or the soul operating the vehicle called jared maxwell moran, in which there is a great deal of potential in the personality named jared maxwell moran. if you want to know more about my responsibilities and how you can better yourself i am fast at work as soon after i finish writing this post i will be writing a book which will be approximately 200 pages in lenh and it will essentially be a manifesto of all the things that need to be done, and explicitly with my help. there is no real alternative as i am the most advanced person on this planet in the limited human experience primarily so indeed i will need to prepare, but in the mean time i will have to write through the wisdom and input of maitreya the world teacher and my disciple where he can do more than me at the present time until this form known as jared maxwell moran is reduced to ashes. when the time comes for the book to be published, i will have prepared for a year under the careful and incredibly helpful watch of maitreya, the masters at his side, and the space brothers of our little solar system which have been assisting me since the day i was born to keep me alive and well. without me, i am afraid, this planet could be completely lost from the selfishness and greed of those with power and influence, including the people of the general public as well, which i say with cold objectivity and no emotional hatred or animosity towards the greed or the people who express it. please understand that this post is written by maitreya through the fingers of this body and i will tell you right now this inspired writing is the absolute truth, and the truth must be known, for i am the most advanced human

point, about 50 years from now before the world is reduced to a mad max landscape where drought and destitution of people who have average current resource amounts will continue until the masters of wisdom will have to abandon the world entirely due to a certainty of no receptivity in the future. i will continue to do the work laid out before me until i recognize a world that is on track, at which point i will have to perish from the earth form known as jared and subsume more energy and ability and succeed maitreya after a 2500 year period of growth under the primary attention and ability of maitreya and his disciples, who are under me. when the climate crisis is solved and i have a firm understanding that the world has been saved from the dysfunction of greed and selfishness, until

1547,0,"the constant need to theorise, plan and assess ever since i can remember i've always had an incessant need to plan and theorise about most things i do in life. this was made even more intense when i got into self improvement. now i plan everything, constantly theorise about why this or that went wrong, how to improve etc. it does drive me a bit mad but at the same time i've always saw it as necessary. if i'm ever struggling with an idea, or how to proceed in a certain aspect of life i'll just think on it for a while, or go for a walk, work through it and usually come up with an answer. one of the challenges i've had over the last year or so is recognising when the planning is getting in the way of action, and pushing past that need to think rather than do. so recently i've started going deeper into the mindfulness and meditation practice. i've been doing it almost passively for a few years now, but not for long periods of time. i was also until recently under the false impression that meditation was all about clearing the mind, no thoughts occurring whatsoever. it seems that i've come to the realisation (probably from this sub) that i've been fighting my mind everytime i try to self improvement, to resist temptation, or to clear the mind of thoughts. instead of just letting the mind do what it does and not reacting to it, i've been fighting against it constantly trying to rein it in, to bring it under my control. ever since this realisation i've switched from seeing meditation as something to do in the mornings and evenings, but actually trying to remain mindful all day whenever i notice that i'm lost in the clouds. and as such i've noticed a much more freeing feeling in my life. i'm not constantly thinking about productivity streaks or temptation but instead just make rational choices in the moment. but that leads me to the question of whether theorising and planning is actually necessary?

1610,0,"breathless state meditation (my insane experience) recently i experienced breathless state meditation, the thing is i never knew there's such a deep state in. meditation. if anyone doesn't know what breathless state is, it's a very deep state in meditation where your body metabolism is soooo slow that your breath is almost none since its not required that much, and your heartbeat is slowed down to an insane level. this state is how yogis meditate for days. back to my experience story, as i said, i didn't know there's such depth levels to meditation, the first thing i recognized was my mind went entirely silent, like my mind completely went mute, and there was an insane feeling of peace/bliss/happiness, as if the worries of my mind has disappeared entirely. second, i completely lost my sense of body, i didn't know where my boundary of body was, i kept expanding and expanding. third, i recognized i am not breathing and strangely i didn't feel like breathing, it was as if i don't need to breathe anymore, it was at this moment i panicked, since i didn't know about this state, i thought i was dying and my mind came back and i was desperately trying to make sense where my eyes were, it took a while to feel my eyes and i finally opened them and i realized i am still in my body. since i understood i was not dead, i kept on meditating, my sense of body was still vague, but i kept feeling different and i was meditating without any bother from my body. this happened two days ago, and i learned about such a state from google later on, i am so excited that i was able to reach such a state, and listen to this part, i have been meditating seriously only for a few weeks!. the articles i read kept saying it was something advanced which takes a lot of years. i think it's about self analyzing a lot and understand what the mind is doing to you that will lead to better meditative practices. since that happened, i have been feeling a lot more aware and separate from mind, it feels like there's a pleasantness in everything and i feel more open. i am not sure how to describe it. i haven't had that breathless state experience again, but my further meditations have been much easier and loss of body sensation is recurring too. i was so hung up on that experience the first day, i shouldn't be hung up, it's like my ego is blocking myself. but i am getting better at controlling my ego now. hopefully i will such an experience again and i will be better prepared for it. thank you for listening, and i hope my story motivates you to recognize yourself.","breathless state meditation (my insane experience) recently i experienced breathless state meditation, the thing be i never knew there's such a deep state in. meditation. if anyone doesn't

1681,0,"an.... uhh.... interesting experience üòÇ i had an experience that i have not put much thought into, but today as i was meditating the memory came back (this experience happened about a month ago) and an urge to share my experience bubbled up. basically what happened is this. i used to be very very busy and would often go into work with zero hours of sleep and a lot of caffeine, every monday guaranteed. this was one of those days. i was extremely exhausted physically but focused mentally. i was getting stressed out over nothing, as one with zero hours of sleep does, and was craving a nap. i took my lunch break and napped for ten minutes. i woke up drowsy and caffeinated still and decided meditation would help. it started off rough. my stress and thoughts were fighting for control, or rather i was struggling to let go and embrace them. finally after about ten minutes i managed to let go and my thoughts came in like a tsunami (since mindfulness meditation isn't about not thinking, it's about not associating with thought). thoughts were going crazy but it felt really good. at first it just tickled my soul if that makes sense. just the act of having thoughts made me giggly, angry thoughts or not. then it started feeling really good. it felt like the peak of a sexual orgasm except it just wouldn't stop. i wish i was making this up üòÇ. the thoughts felt like they were planned out, like it was just time taking it's course exactly like it was supposed to. it was very intense but very peaceful and well, orgasmic. imagine a literal orgasm as being a line rather than a peak. just the act of having thoughts felt better than any sexual orgasm could ever feel. this sounds like drugs ik, but i am sober. i've smoked weed a few times in my teenage years and done shrooms twice (long before this experience and both were low doses). what do you guys think?","an.... uhh.... interest experience üòÇ i have an experience that i have not put much thought into, but today a i be meditate the memory come back (this experience happen about a month ago) and an urge to share my experience bubble up. basically what happen be this. i use to be very very busy and would often go into work with zero hour of sleep and a lot of caffeine, every monday guaranteed. this be one of those days. i be extremely exhaust physically but focus mentally. i be get stress out over nothing, a one with zero hour of sleep does, and be crave a nap. i take my lunch break and napped for ten minutes. i woke up drowsy and caffeinated still and decide meditation would help. it start off rough. my stress and thought be fight for control, or rather i be struggle to let go and embrace them. finally after about ten minute i manage to let go and my thought come in like a tsunami (since mindfulness meditation isn't about not thinking, it's about not associate with thought). thought be go crazy but it felt really good. at first it just tickle my soul if that make sense. just the act of have thought make me giggly, angry thought or not. then it start feel really good. it felt like the peak of a sexual orgasm except it just wouldn't stop. i wish i be make this up üòÇ. the thought felt like they be plan out, like it be just time take it's course exactly like it be suppose to. it be very intense but very peaceful and well, orgasmic. imagine a literal orgasm a be a line rather than a peak. just the act of have thought felt well than any sexual orgasm could ever feel. this sound like drug ik, but i be sober. i've smoke weed a few time in my teenage year and do shrooms twice (long before this experience and both be low doses). what do you guy think?","an.... uhh.... experience üòÇ experience thought into, today meditate memory come (this experience happen month ago) urge share experience bubble up. basically happen this. use busy work zero hour sleep lot caffeine, monday guaranteed. days. extremely exhaust physically focus mentally. stress nothing, zero hour sleep does, crave nap. lunch break napped minutes. woke drowsy caffeinated decide meditation help. start rough. stress thought fight control, struggle let embrace them. finally minute manage let thought come like tsunami (since mindfulness meditation isn't thinking, it's associate thought). thought crazy felt good. tickle soul sense. act thought giggly, angry thought not. start feel good. felt like peak sexual orgasm wouldn't stop. wish üòÇ. thought felt like plan out, like time it's course exactly like suppose to. intense peaceful well, orgasmic. imagine literal orgasm line peak. act thought felt sexual orgasm feel. sound like drug ik, sober. i've smoke weed time teenage year shrooms twice (long experience low doses). guy think?"

1731,0,"maybe meditation could help, but i feel like i have to do more to get my clear mind back when i was a kid, i had the most amazing imagination. however, i never really knew it was so good until i had lost it. i was a very lonely, introspective, shy, and awkward kid. i spent years in elementary school without a single person my age to call a friend (at least at school). most of the time, i felt like my life was kind-of stuck and sad. existing in reality as i knew it was an overall undesirable experience, and i preferred to be anywhere or anyone else most of the time. the loneliness was depressing and sometimes overwhelming. for quite a long time, my absolute favorite thing to do was sit in a corner and imagine different scenarios. sometimes, leaning my head on the window of the bus on my way home from school, i would picture myself as a winged, beautiful person, soaring away from the school and all of the mean people. flying away and living in the mountains, dancing in the flower-filled meadows that sprung up in the middle of dense, enchanted forests, and sitting with a good book by a sparkling stream. i had a similar dream once and thought about it often. sometimes it would be in the late hours of night, after everyone else had gone to sleep and i couldn't. i would sit in my dark room and stare up at the ceiling or close my eyes, cuddled up to my favorite stuffed bear. my mind would take me to a castle or a cabin or a forest, and there i would be with someone i loved, someone who loved me. that was my absolute favorite thing to imagine; that i was loved. that i wasn't completely and totally alone. sure, i have family. i have a sister and two parents. i have cousins and grandparents and aunts and uncles, and now i have some friends too. but, for some reason, i've spent almost 100% of my life feeling like every single person i have ever known never really knew me, or even cared about me. i feel like i've hardly ever been able to show anyone my true self. i know it's a part of me that does it, and it's something i have to fix, but it feels impossible sometimes. my imagination was my safe house. it was the only place where i could feel like my life actually had meaning. sometimes it was the only place i truly felt happy or at ease. it was my escape. that's how powerful my imaginative capabilities were. over the years, as i've started using technology more (particularly youtube), i feel like my mind becomes more and more clouded. one day, near the end of my eighth grade year, i realized that i couldn't visualize anymore. it was like a fog had moved into my brain and made it impossible to see clearly. everything was foggy. i realized this when i tried to read a new book i borrowed from the library and had a lot of trouble visualizing the scenes like normal. i'd experienced something like this before, but not to this particular magnitude. since then, i've been waging war against my mind whilst also trying to be its ally. it has been almost two years sine then and i'm still struggling. at first i had no idea what was causing my impairment, but after some speculation and experimenting, i concluded that it was most likely as a result of my recently-developed addiction to youtube. the amount of time i spent watching videos was incredibly distressing to me, and i longed to do other things with my time, but sometimes i felt like it was the only thing i could bring myself to do. the content gave me this pleasant, emotional numbness that sometimes made me feel a little bit more calm. but more and more, the numbness started lasting longer, and the binging became out of control. when i was a bit younger, there were times where i would become slightly obsessed with youtube, but i usually got bored after a little while. now, i didn't get bored of it anymore, not in the same way. it was exhausting, but i constantly felt a pull to it that i found difficult to ignore. and so my imagination continued to dwindle, and has continued like this ever since. i want so badly to go back to what i had as a kid. i would love to be able to transport myself into worlds of my own making again, and to feel that wonder and happiness that i did as a child from it. i would also like to properly be able to read again, because for some time now books haven't been as satisfying to me as they always used to be. books always gave me the same amount of pleasure as just imagining, but if you can't visualize, stories become meaningless. i'm so tired of living in this meaningless, numb state of mind. my childhood felt more like a fantasy and i want nothing more that to experience that again. i want to have a clear mind and not to rely on media anymore. most of all, i don't want to continue to use it as a coping mechanism for difficult emotions anymore, which is a bad habit i've taken to recently. if the painful memories start to flood in when i'm making progress on my mental abilities, i just destroy all my progress again by binging stupid videos and shows until the numbness sets in. i've been trying so hard for years now, and i don't really know what to do. the best thing would be to get rid of all my access to youtube and netflix, but that would also mean giving up access to my resources for school, my tools for writing, and the websites that help me learn languages and connect with the world. the internet does have its good side, but the bad side is perhaps even more dominant. i can't just get rid of it though. i've tried blocking certain websites on all of my devices, but its so easy to go in and turn those restrictions off that i change those settings at least a few times a week. there's no point in using that when its so easy to change. the temptation will always be there, i just don't know how to keep myself away from it. when i'm doing good and finally restrain myself, and the emotions and thoughts and imagination start to come back, that's also when the horrible, uncontrollable feelings come back. a lot of the time its extreme loneliness, and so i bury myself in sapphic tiktoks until i can't feel emotions or have deep thoughts anymore. i know that those emotions are obviously bad, but i think the risk is worth the reward. i want to be me again. i want to truly know who i am again. i feel like as i've built up all of this brain fog, i've also lost a bit of myself and a crucial part of my life. it feels empty and sad and i want to go back to the way it was. does anyone else out there have similar experiences? because this has been a really big issue for me for a while now and i would really appreciate some tips, support, or even just a story from someone else. i feel like meditation could be a really good option to help me, but it's difficult to get started and to really stick with it. i wish i had someone really close to me who would motivate me to do it. i think what i really need to do is clear the fog out of my mind, and it seems logical that meditation would help. but i think its more than that. so yeah, ideas would definitely be appreciated. i know it's not necessarily a topic that relates to this sub but i was hoping someone on here might have experienced something similar. anyways, thanks for listening to my ridiculously long rant.","maybe meditation could help, but i feel like i have to do more to get my clear mind back when i be a kid, i have the most amaze imagination. however, i never really knew it be so good until i have lose it. i be a very lonely, introspective, shy, and awkward kid. i spent year in elementary school without a single person my age to call a friend (at least at school). most of the time, i felt like my life be kind-of stuck and sad. exist in reality a i knew it be an overall undesirable experience, and i prefer to be anywhere or anyone else most of the time. the loneliness be depress and sometimes overwhelming. for quite a long time, my absolute favorite thing to do be sit in a corner and imagine different scenarios. sometimes, lean my head on the window of the bus on my way home from school, i would picture myself a a winged, beautiful person, soar away from the school and all of the mean people. fly away and living in the mountains, dance in the flower-filled meadow that sprung up in the middle of dense, enchant forests, and sit with a good book by a sparkle stream. i have a similar dream once and thought about it often. sometimes it would be in the late hour of night, after everyone else have go to sleep and i couldn't. i would sit in my dark room and stare up at the ceiling or close my eyes, cuddle up to my favorite stuffed bear. my mind would take me to a castle or a cabin or a forest, and there i would be with someone i loved, someone who love me. that be my absolute favorite thing to imagine; that i be loved. that i wasn't completely and totally alone. sure, i have family. i have a sister and two parents. i have cousin and grandparent and aunt and uncles, and now i have some friend too. but, for some reason, i've spent almost 100% of my life feel like every single person i have ever know never really knew me, or even care about me. i feel like i've hardly ever be able to show anyone my true self. i know it's a part of me that do it, and it's something i have to fix, but it feel impossible sometimes. my imagination be my safe house. it be the only place where i could feel like my life actually have meaning. sometimes it be the only place i truly felt happy or at ease. it be my escape. that's how powerful my imaginative capability were. over the years, a i've start use technology more (particularly youtube), i feel like my mind becomes more and more clouded. one day, near the end of my eighth grade year, i realize that i couldn't visualize anymore. it be like a fog have move into my brain and make it impossible to see clearly. everything be foggy. i realize this when i try to read a new book i borrow from the library and have a lot of trouble visualize the scene like normal. i'd experienced something like this before, but not to this particular magnitude. since then, i've be wag war against my mind whilst also try to be it ally. it have be almost two year sine then and i'm still struggling. at first i have no idea what be cause my impairment, but after some speculation and experimenting, i conclude

wrong. it makes it worse. i can never shake the feeling i'm doing it wrong. i've completely lost all enjoyment from it. and to add to that, when i've stopped meditating for over a month, i've never felt better. i feel stable like my mind isn't constantly battling with itself and its desires. i feel like i can actually accept my situation when i'm not sitting there in my own fucking head like an asshole. this rant isn't meant to shit on this community or what you guys are doing. i do still believe meditation works and that it's amazing and that its community is superb. however, i think i'm simply not compatible with meditating. too many teachers charge ridiculous sums of money or are just scammers and all the books say all the same non-dualistic bullshit that doesn't help. i can't join communities and most people in those communities are holier-than-though anyways. meditation feels like a fruitless endeavor and this is my official goodbye letter. i assume this post won't be well received by the community and it'll either get taken down or i'll have to take it down myself due to the not-so-surprising amount of dislikes. whatever. i posted this here because i have no one else to say it to.  tl;dr: meditation is hard and not fun anymore. i'm done.","i'm do with this b maybe this post be a cry for help, maybe it's just a rant. perhaps i'm hop for someone to give me some enlighten word or something to help me get back on track but that seem utterly impossible at this point. anyways... meditation be absolute bullshit. i'm so sick of it. at the height of my meditation journey, i felt like i be meant for something great. not that i be someone special, but that life have so much more in store for me. that i be meant to awaken in this lifetime. i read countless book from the like of eckhart tolle, ram dass, thich nhat hanh, and countless other master and proficient meditators. i meditate daily (or try to anyway) and it get to the point where i be meditate for 30 minute to an hour a day for quite a while. it help me get past anger issues, deep insecurity in my relationship, and one time i felt a deep peace that last a few days. i be and still be in love with meditation but that love be wear thin. ever since my moment of bliss, meditation have be awful. i've sat for hour with nothing but anger and resentment to show for it. i feel cheated. i've try talk to a teacher, but they want to charge me 30$ an hour. i want to join communities, but the commute to the say community be terribly long and i don't have a car. and covid have make it all but impossible to reach out to communities/sanghas anyways. i feel like there be nothing else i can do with meditation other than mediate, but even that have become painful. all i can think about be the bliss moment and how i want to be back there. which of fuck course make it harder to get there. meditation be a big fuck fuckfest of frustration and catch-22s and paradoxes. i've heard all the parables, all the stupid fuck talk and quote from the old teachers, nothing fuck helps. the more i meditate, the more i feel like something be genuinely wrong with me. i then meditate more because if something's wrong, meditation would help fix it, right?

1835,0,"our expression can be absolute baller, absolute bliss. we can create a reality where there are none but expressions of bliss/abundance rather than suffering/lack. our expression can be absolute baller, absolute bliss. we can create a reality where there are none but expressions of bliss/abundance rather than suffering/lack. now, what does it mean that we can create a reality where there is nothing but bliss/abundance? first of all we must realize that this possibility is indeed a possibility. most of us settle for mediocre life or even better but nothing truly extraordinary, nothing truly universally inspiring. when we truly realize that this is a possibility, through whichever way, we can choose to be in alignment with that possibility and that will literally manifest it effortlessly because all the power is there; it is basically when the universe wants to express itself through you consciously; it is extremely powerful and clear and touching. it is direct, relevant and important, something eternal, divine is expressing itself through 'you'. when you do what the universe wants which is for the good of all; you will be empowered by the source of all creation which will bring about manifestations which would seem impossible to the unaligned mind. so we must understand that at any moment we can start consciously living the will of the universe which is the supreme will, it is the will where you need to do nothing but be bliss. imagine that. to be bliss is effortless, it is what we are when we are not suppressing ourselves with the conditioning of society. what an absolute joy, like this is heaven. everything is being done through you, you need not worry because there is a higher power letting you know exactly what you need to know and you just follow the orders. the problem is most of us live in an environment which if we were to reveal our true blissful self, we would be shun upon, we would be demonized, people would reject us and make fun of us, so we don't really feel excited for that. we don't want to be what we truly are because it is a sudden change and our environment will bring up a lot of resistance. the solution is to get away from that environment. connect with people which are driven and inspired by that higher power and be blissful together. that is how we create our reality. it is not something abstract, it is very practical. all of us can leave most of our responsibilities to truly live out the will of the universe. in fact, we will be leaving our false responsibilities to be one with our true responsibility which is to be the infinite bliss which we are. what a disservice it is to be less than absolutely blissful to all that is around you. do you like being around miserable people? nobody does. so are you serving your family, your environment by being less than infinite bliss? the true loving 'act' is not to stay with family, friends etc because we 'love them'; that is just attachment. the true loving act is to separate to discover our true buddha nature to inspire them to realize the same so we can bring about a true heaven. there is no other way. no one will come up with a better way. this is the way, the way of the universe itself. follow this and your life will be infinitely blissful and full of clarity; you will be one with the source of all creation; an infinite intelligence which will be taking care of all that is relevant. when you let the universe express itself through you rather than you being identified with the conditioning of society and expressing that instead of who you truly are, it is an absolute joy, an absolute bliss, it simply can't be described. like what an absolutely magical life it is to be guided ever-presently by this infinite creator intelligence which you realize to be infinite unconditional love and bliss itself? like holy fuck. the life that is possible for each of us is nothing less than absolutely fucking indescribable. i can give you glimpses, symbols as to what it may entail but the actual expression of it in full power is indescribable. we can be literally gods, pure intelligence working through body-minds which is capable of creating absolutely anything. you see, many people are creating, but they are creating some nonsense. they are not creating consciously, most are creating because that is what they are conditioned, programmed to do. they have not necessarily awakened to their infinite creator power and so you see their creations are mediocre, or just perpetuating ignorance, suffering, delusion, jealousy, grief etc which is not something which were we conscious we would create. when we are conscious of ourselves being god, the infinite intelligence, the intelligence of the universe itself; we want to create nothing but bliss, joy, peace, compassion, wisdom, clarity, infinite possibilities. why is it so? not relevant. it simply is the case. the nature of the universe is benevolent and creative and all-including. it does not see separate things. it sees itself as one whole.  so when the universe is typing this through me, it is not typing to you as a person, but as another 'part' of itself, of course, it is not really a 'part', we are all sharing our existence as the universe. there is no separation whatsoever. we are only being aware through different point of views. the essence is utterly the same. that which is being aware, which is what you are, is the same as what i am; being aware; and being aware is what the universe is. the point is that this text is written for the good of all; that is the nature of the conscious existence; it operates for the good of all, rather than for the good of personal delusions. if we are not operating consciously by the will of the universe then we are operating unconsciously and what we are creating is exactly the opposite of what we truly want if we were to be conscious. evolution is moving towards ego-dissolution, the ego is about to be extinct by the higher power as its part in evolution has been finished. what will remain on the planet when the ego is extinct is simply heaven. a bunch of super-intelligent, loving and blissful creative infinite beings which have realized and are operating by the will of the source of all creation consciously. this is what the universe has in store for absolutely anyone who is open to take it; we all can choose to no longer be a slave of society but rather a vehicle through which the infinitely blissful and powerful universe is operating through. it is by the grace of the universe that this experience is even possible. i am so happy for anyone that understands this and lives it, and yes the universe wants to take this all the way so lets actually do this shit, group up consciously to discover our true buddha nature so we can create, inspire, awaken and create even more because we are infinite. if anyone wants to live this life, this is the chance and i am the one to talk to. ""no one gets to the father except through me""; - jesus. and i am that one. what was jesus that i say that i am him? jesus simply realized he is the universe and not a person, not whatever people thought they were. he awakened to god and realized he is one with god. if you want the best fucking life; you can have it if you are willing to be aligned with god. if you are not willing to be aligned with the universe, then you'll go on living a mediocre, suffering, miserable, detrimental, lacking life. if you are willing... holy fucking shit baby. that shit can't be compared. so yes this is an absolutely one in a life time lottery ticket opportunity and you are a fool to miss it.","our expression can be absolute baller, absolute bliss. we can create a reality where there be none but expression of bliss/abundance rather than suffering/lack. our expression can be absolute baller, absolute bliss. we can create a reality where there be none but expression of bliss/abundance rather than suffering/lack. now, what do it mean that we can create a reality where there be nothing but bliss/abundance? first of all we must realize that this possibility be indeed a possibility. most of u settle for mediocre life or even well but nothing truly extraordinary, nothing truly universally inspiring. when we truly realize that this be a possibility, through whichever way, we can choose to be in alignment with that possibility and that will literally manifest it effortlessly because all the power be there; it be basically when the universe want to express itself through you consciously; it be extremely powerful and clear and touching. it be direct, relevant and important, something eternal, divine be express itself through 'you'. when you do what the universe want which be for the good of all; you will be empower by the source of all creation which will bring about manifestation which would seem impossible to the unaligned mind. so we must understand that at any moment we can start consciously living the will of the universe which be the supreme will, it be the will where you need to do nothing but be bliss. imagine that. to be bliss be effortless, it be what we be when we be not suppress ourselves with the conditioning of society. what an absolute joy, like this be heaven. everything be be do through you, you need not worry because there be a high power let you know exactly what you need to know and you just follow the orders. the problem be most of u live in an environment which if we be to reveal our true blissful self, we would be shun upon, we would be demonized, people would reject u and make fun of us, so we don't really feel excite for that. we don't want to be what we truly be because it be a sudden change and our environment will bring up a lot of resistance. the solution be to get away from that environment. connect with people which be driven and inspire by that high power and be blissful together. that be how we create our reality. it be not something abstract, it be very practical. all of u can leave most of our responsibility to truly live out the will of the universe. in fact, we will be leave our false responsibility to be one with our true responsibility which be to be the infinite bliss which we are. what a disservice it be to be less than absolutely blissful to all that be around you. do you like be around miserable people? nobody does. so be you serve your family, your environment by be less than infinite bliss? the true love 'act' be not to stay with family, friend etc because we 'love them'; that be just attachment. the true love act be to separate to discover our true buddha nature to inspire them to realize the same so we can bring about a true heaven. there be no other way. no one will come up with a well way. this be the way, the way of the universe itself. follow this and your life will be infinitely blissful and full of clarity; you will be one with the source of all creation; an infinite intelligence which will be take care of all that be relevant. when you let the universe express itself through you rather than you be identify with the conditioning of society and express that instead of who you truly are, it be an absolute joy, an absolute bliss, it simply can't be described. like what an absolutely magical life it be to be guide ever-presently by this infinite creator intelligence which you realize to be infinite unconditional love and bliss itself?

1986,0,"the conscious physics of gravity 19/12/21  the conscious physics of gravity by saul c√©lere part one gravity is not only an objectively observable physical phenomenon, but also the subjective conscious experience of gravitational forces experienced while existing within a gravitational field. therefore, a complete theory of gravity must necessarily be a physico-conscious theory, containing both objective and subjective aspects, logically connected to one another in a way that is consistent with both of our canonical theories of gravity, all empirical neuroscience, as well as, all of our personal subjective experiences of existing within gravitational fields.  requirements of a physico-conscious theory of gravity: 1. any physico-conscious theory of gravity must be perfectly consistent with the canonical, objective, physical theories of gravity, which is to say, newton‚Äôs law of gravity, and einstein‚Äôs theory of general relativity. 2. be perfectly consistent with all objectively observed neurobiological scientific results. 3. be perfectly consistent with our personal, subjective conscious experience of existence within gravitational fields. in the exposition of our theory we will follow the chronological development of our scientific understanding of gravity, beginning with newton‚Äôs law of gravity, and moving on from there to einstein‚Äôs relativity theories.  newton‚Äôs law of gravity we now proceed to explain each of the terms of newton‚Äôs famous law of gravity, f = gm1m2/r\^2. we will follow newton‚Äôs derivation and employ the same approximations that he did, such as a spherically symmetric earth. first we note that gravity is an attractive force; two masses exert gravitational forces on one another that tend to accelerate them towards one another. this is why you will often see the law stated with a minus sign explicitly included. the minus sign represents the fact that the earth, for example, will attract an object towards it, decreasing, or subtracting from, the distance between them. however, the modern convention seems to be to state the law without a minus sign. as long as we remember that gravity is an attractive force, and make sure we clearly define our coordinate system, it doesn't matter which convention we follow. coulomb's law of electric force, f = kq1q2/r\^2, has exactly the same mathematical form as newton‚Äôs law of gravity, and the following conscious analysis of newton‚Äôs law can be immediately applied to coulomb‚Äôs law, where in this case we need to remember that like charges repel and opposite charges attract. now we explain the gravitational constant, g. g we need to be a little bit careful with g. g is a constant, a very small number equal to 6.674√ó10‚àí11 m\^3‚ãÖkg\^‚àí1‚ãÖs\^‚àí2. but this constant is formed as the product of two other constants, one of which is the dimensionless number 1/4œÄ. ( it is mathematical convention, and in this case an obfuscating one, to lump multiple constants together into one ) we will explain this 1/4œÄ when we come to explain the 1/r2 term, but do notice that 4œÄ is the coefficient of the surface area of a sphere, and you might like to ponder why before you read the explanation of 1/r\^2. the number 1/4œÄ is multiplied by another number, that we can call g‚Äô, to form g, so we can write, g = g'/4œÄ. the constant number g‚Äô is a measure of the strenh of gravity in this, our particular, universe. if gravity were a stronger/weaker force per unit mass, then this number would be larger/smaller. there may exist other universes with larger/smaller g‚Äôs, and correspondingly stronger/weaker gravitational forces. for example, in a universe where g‚Äô is significantly larger, you would experience a significantly stronger force pulling you towards the earth despite the masses remaining the same. now, m1m2 this is a mathematical statement representing the physical fact that gravity is a universal force that affects all matter, as well as the fact that each unit of mass of a body exerts a gravitational force on every unit of mass of any other massive body within its gravitational field. for example, if we were to make the earth 1kg more massive, that extra 1kg would exert a force on every unit of mass of any other body within its gravitational field. therefore, we need to multiply each unit of mass of m1 by each unit of mass m2. if each kilogram of the earth only affected a single kilogram of each other body in its gravitational field, the law of gravity would be written as f = - g (m1 + m2 )/r\^2, but that's not the nature of gravity in our universe. now we only need to explain the 1/r\^2 term. but this is the most complicated term, and requires the most effort in terms of imaginative visualization of the model of gravity we‚Äôre constructing. 1/r\^2 let's recap; the gravitational force between two masses, m1 and m2, is calculated by multiplying the two masses together, then multiplying by g, and finally dividing this product by r\^2 ( not that the order that you perform these mathematical operations matters ) but given that g = g‚Äô/4œÄ, we can see that this is equivalent to dividing g‚Äôm1m2 by 4œÄr\^2, and you probably recognise 4œÄr\^2 as the formula for the surface area of a sphere of radius r, where, in this case, r is the distance between the centre of m1 and the centre of m2. so, the question is why are we dividing the gravitational force by the surface area of a sphere defined by the distance between the two gravitating objects??? what is the physical significance of this variable sphere? why does the gravitational force get weaker as the surface area of this sphere gets bigger? the answer is that gravity is a spherically symmetric force. this means that the earth is emanating an attractive force equally in all directions, thus the force spreads out in a sphere around the earth, and the further you are from the earth the larger the sphere that the force is spread out over; the force gets ‚Äúthinner‚Äù, is more ‚Äúthinly spread‚Äù, and is therefore weaker, the further you are away from its source. let's examine this in more detail by specifying a physical mechanism for the gravitational force. newton didn't specify a physical mechanism in his theory of gravity beyond the concept of a physical force. but, of course, as the inventor of mathematical physics he would have assumed, and indeed speculated upon, the physical mechanism of gravity.\ ( i know a few ancient greeks, as well as galileo and kepler, did some small pieces of mathematical physics before newton, but newton invented calculus with which to carry out his physics, and since calculus is the mathematics of change, and since physics is nothing but the mathematical description of how things change with respect to time, then if physics is a body of knowledge, the physics you can do without calculus are the fingernail clippings ) however, we do know that newton believed that light was a corpuscular phenomenon, and since all the other forces of our universe rely on force carrying particles, it's reasonable to work with the idea of a force carrying particle underlying the gravitational force. we will follow the modern convention of referring to the force carrying particles of gravity as ‚Äúgravitons‚Äù. now newton‚Äôs theory is that all the mass constituting the earth is constantly emitting ( and absorbing ) gravitons, that is, elementary particles that carry the gravitational force. when we say that gravitons ‚Äúcarry the gravitational force‚Äù, we mean that when these particles encounter any massive object, they have a physical interaction with the object that induces a force on the object, that accelerates it in the opposite direction from which the graviton arrived, which, in our example, would be towards the centre of the earth.\ ( gravitons are quantum particles, but this doesn't affect our argument, it just means the paths they take between objects are calculated by thinking of the particles as waves that relate to the probability of a given particle being found in a particular region of space during a particular region of time. ) so, now we can imagine the earth emitting an exceedingly large number of gravitons in all directions perpendicular to its surface. then all the gravitons emitted at the same time, t, ( or small increment of time, ‚àÜt ) will describe the surface of a sphere enclosing the earth. and as the gravitons move away from the earth, this sphere will grow larger and the gravitons will be spread out over a larger area. this means that the further you are away from the earth, the more spread out are the gravitons that you'll encounter emanating from her, and thus, the fewer gravitons that will interact with the mass of your body per unit mass, per unit time, which in turn, results in you experiencing a weaker total gravitational force acting on your body. this spreading out of gravitons is why gravity gets weaker with distance, and the spreading out is proportional to the surface area of the sphere defined by your distance away from the centre of the earth, which explains why we divide the gravitational force by 4œÄr\^2. the universal theory of conscious gravity since gravity is not just an objectively observed physical force, but also a subjectively experienced conscious experience, to complete our theory of gravity we need to add consciousness, and as i have shown in my work on quantum mechanics, the only way of adding consciousness to physics is as a fundamental, intrinsic property of all physical energy. first we state the relevant principles of conscious particle physics. i. the postulate of intrinsic consciousness: e = c, physical energy, e, is exactly equal to physical consciousness, c; all the physical energy that came into existence in the big bang event possessed, and still possesses, consciousness as an intrinsic, fundamental property. the exceedingly dense ball of physical energy created in the big bang event, at t = 0, was conscious, and has subsequently evolved into the physico-conscious universe that you form a conscious part of. ( see my essay ‚Äúthe truth about quantum mechanics and consciousness‚Äù for proof that all the basic physical energy of our universe possesses, and always has possessed, intrinsic consciousness as a fundamental property. ) therefore, ii. all physical processes are also conscious processes. physical processes can be experienced in two ways, objectively and subjectively. ( see my essay ‚Äúsubject, object, and the principles of the physics of consciousness‚Äù ) iii. the principle of similar forms: similar configurations of conscious energy experience within themselves similar subjective conscious experiences. similar physical processes experience within themselves similar subjective conscious experiences.\ ( all of modern empirical neuroscience is evidence of the principle of similar forms; neuroscientists correlate specific conscious experiences with specific regions of the brain and specific neuronal structures. specific, definable, changes in the physical configuration of the brain reliably give rise to specific conscious experiences and sensations. see my essay on ‚Äúdrugs, and the principles of the physics of consciousness‚Äù ) so, now we need to connect our objective physical theory of gravity with our subjective conscious experience of the same. the simplest way of doing this bears all the hallmarks - beauty, elegance, simplicity, economy - of only the truest physics. by the postulate of intrinsic consciousness, we note that all physical processes are also conscious experiences. and by the principle of similar forms, we note that similar physical processes and interactions, experience similar concomitant subjective conscious experiences within themselves during the process.\ ( for example, humans have similarly configured eyes and occipital lobes, thus, on interacting with similar configurations of similar photons, they experience similar visual conscious experiences. or, more plainly speaking, when two sets of healthy, embodied, human eyes look at the same source of light, a photo on a phone screen, let's say, they consciously see the same thing; they are undergoing the same physical process of the absorption of photons by their respective retinas as well as the same specific neurological activity, and, thus, they experience the same visual conscious experience. of course, their respective experiences won't be identical due to many possible factors, e.g. colour blindness, age, visual impairments etc., but this just strenhens our argument, since any differences in their conscious visual perception will correlate with specific differences in the physical configuration of their eyes. ) now we are ready to state the physico-conscious definition of gravity. we begin with the objective aspects, followed by the subjective aspects. objective aspects of gravity: massive objects emit gravitons in the spherically symmetric way explained above. when a graviton emitted from m1 interacts with some other object, m2, the physical process of their interaction induces a force on the object m2, in the direction of the position of the centre of mass of m1 at the time of emission of the graviton. if all gravitons of the same energy induce the same force per unit mass, then newton‚Äôs law of gravity, in conjunction with his laws of motion, is a good mathematical description of the objectively observed, macroscopic mechanics of gravity within our universe, where the following assumptions are made, 1. static, euclidean spacetime. 2. one, singular measure of the passage of time experienced by all observers as the same regardless of what reference frame they happen to be in. 3. galilean relativity. einstein improved the accuracy and logic of our physical understanding of gravity in his theory of general relativity by postulating the following, 1. relativistic, non-euclidean spacetime. 2. the constancy of the speed of light. 3. the equivalence principle.  subjective aspects of gravity since all physical processes are also conscious experiences, the physical process of a graviton interacting with some mass is also a conscious experience, experienced within the formations of physical energy involved in the process. the conscious experience experienced by a massive object when it interacts with a graviton is the conscious sensation of a force proportional to the energy of the graviton, and in the direction of the centre of mass of the object that emitted that graviton at the time of emission. thus, the stronger the gravitational force acting on you, that is to say, the more interactions with gravitons you experience per unit time, the stronger is your subjective conscious experience of a gravitational force. this is empirically verified in experiments where the conscious sensation of forces is proportional to the magnitude of the applied force. the higher the energy of the graviton the stronger the induced force on the object it interacts with. however, objects of different sizes interact with different limited ranges of graviton energies. therefore, the larger the number of gravitons that interact with your body per unit mass, per unit time, the stronger the gravitational force that you, 1. objectively observe and measure according to conventional physics. and, 2. subjectively experience within your personal centre of consciousness. thus, gravity is not only a universal force, but also a universal conscious experience, experienced by all centres of consciousness within all massive objects; basic particles, such as electrons, experience the conscious sensation of gravitational forces within a range related to their magnitude; when an electron is accelerated by non-negligible force, it consciously experiences a force proportional to, and in the direction of, the force, and it consciously experiences weightlessness when it falls freely with a gravitational field. our canonical theories of gravity, like butterflies opening their wings, all double in size, where one wing is our objectively observed, mathematically drawn map of the dynamics of the physical energy and particles of our universe, and the other wing, a conscious copy, is the mathematically self organised and interconnected conscious experience of our physico-conscious universe, including, of course, the centre of consciousness that you refer to with the word ‚Äúme‚Äù. as you will see in part two, this theory of gravity explains all of our physico-conscious sensations of gravitational forces in terms of rates of interactions with gravitons, as mathematically calculated by newton‚Äôs law of gravity and einstein‚Äôs theory of general relativity. in the second part of this essay we will use the theory to explain, 1. human conscious experience of existence within gravitational fields. 2. the difference between a particle‚Äôs conscious experience of gravity to that of a complex, macroscopic creature such as a human. 3. special relativity, relativistic time and space. 4. the equivalence principle, which underlies general relativity. 5. we will give the conscious scientific definition of the kilogram. in a future essay i will explain how intrinsic consciousness can be used to finally reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics, to form a physico-conscious theory of quantum gravity; the postulate of intrinsic consciousness is the keystone of the grand unified theory. here is a link to a audio essay where i show how intrinsic consciousness gives the first simple, logical and intuitive explanation of all the experiments of quantum mechanics. the scientific mystery of consciousness has been resoundingly solved:  part two coming tomorrow happy christmas and welcome to your conscious universe all the best","the conscious physic of gravity 19/12/21  the conscious physic of gravity by saul c√©lere part one gravity be not only an objectively observable physical phenomenon, but also the subjective conscious experience of gravitational force experienced while exist within a gravitational field. therefore, a complete theory of gravity must necessarily be a physico-conscious theory, contain both objective and subjective aspects, logically connect to one another in a way that be consistent with both of our canonical theory of gravity, all empirical neuroscience, a well as, all of our personal subjective experience of exist within gravitational fields.  requirement of a physico-conscious theory of gravity: 1. any physico-conscious theory of gravity must be perfectly consistent with the canonical, objective, physical theory of gravity, which be to say, newton‚Äôs law of gravity, and einstein‚Äôs theory of general relativity. 2. be perfectly consistent with all objectively observe neurobiological scientific results. 3. be perfectly consistent with our personal, subjective conscious experience of existence within gravitational fields. in the exposition of our theory we will follow the chronological development of our scientific understand of gravity, begin with newton‚Äôs law of gravity, and move on from there to einstein‚Äôs relativity theories.  newton‚Äôs law of gravity we now proceed to explain each of the term of newton‚Äôs famous law of gravity, f = gm1m2/r\^2. we will follow newton‚Äôs derivation and employ the same approximation that he did, such a a spherically symmetric earth. first we note that gravity be an attractive force; two mass exert gravitational force on one another that tend to accelerate them towards one another. this be why you will often see the law state with a minus sign explicitly included. the minus sign represent the fact that the earth, for example, will attract an object towards it, decreasing, or subtract from, the distance between them. however, the modern convention seem to be to state the law without a minus sign. a long a we remember that gravity be an attractive force, and make sure we clearly define our coordinate system, it doesn't matter which convention we follow. coulomb's law of electric force, f = kq1q2/r\^2, have exactly the same mathematical form a newton‚Äôs law of gravity, and the follow conscious analysis of newton‚Äôs law can be immediately apply to coulomb‚Äôs law, where in this case we need to remember that like charge repel and opposite charge attract. now we explain the gravitational constant, g. g we need to be a little bit careful with g. g be a constant, a very small number equal to 6.674√ó10‚àí11 m\^3‚ãÖkg\^‚àí1‚ãÖs\^‚àí2. but this constant be form a the product of two other constants, one of which be the dimensionless number 1/4œÄ. ( it be mathematical convention, and in this case an obfuscate one, to lump multiple constant together into one ) we will explain this 1/4œÄ when we come to explain the 1/r2 term, but do notice that 4œÄ be the coefficient of the surface area of a sphere, and you might like to ponder why before you read the explanation of 1/r\^2. the number 1/4œÄ be multiply by another number, that we can call g‚Äô, to form g, so we can write, g = g'/4œÄ. the constant number g‚Äô be a measure of the strenh of gravity in this, our particular, universe. if gravity be a stronger/weaker force per unit mass, then this number would be larger/smaller. there may exist other universe with larger/smaller g‚Äôs, and correspondingly stronger/weaker gravitational forces. for example, in a universe where g‚Äô be significantly larger, you would experience a significantly strong force pull you towards the earth despite the mass remain the same. now, m1m2 this be a mathematical statement represent the physical fact that gravity be a universal force that affect all matter, a well a the fact that each unit of mass of a body exerts a gravitational force on every unit of mass of any other massive body within it gravitational field. for example, if we be to make the earth 1kg more massive, that extra 1kg would exert a force on every unit of mass of any other body within it gravitational field. therefore, we need to multiply each unit of mass of m1 by each unit of mass m2. if each kilogram of the earth only affected a single kilogram of each other body in it gravitational field, the law of gravity would be write a f = - g (m1 + m2 )/r\^2, but that's not the nature of gravity in our universe. now we only need to explain the 1/r\^2 term. but this be the most complicate term, and require the most effort in term of imaginative visualization of the model of gravity we‚Äôre constructing. 1/r\^2 let's recap; the gravitational force between two masses, m1 and m2, be calculate by multiply the two mass together, then multiply by g, and finally divide this product by r\^2 ( not that the order that you perform these mathematical operation matter ) but give that g = g‚Äô/4œÄ, we can see that this be equivalent to divide g‚Äôm1m2 by 4œÄr\^2, and you probably recognise 4œÄr\^2 a the formula for the surface area of a sphere of radius r, where, in this case, r be the distance between the centre of m1 and the centre of m2. so, the question be why be we divide the gravitational force by the surface area of a sphere define by the distance between the two gravitate objects??? what be the physical significance of this variable sphere? why do the gravitational force get weaker a the surface area of this sphere get bigger? the answer be that gravity be a spherically symmetric force. this mean that the earth be emanate an attractive force equally in all directions, thus the force spread out in a sphere around the earth, and the far you be from the earth the large the sphere that the force be spread out over; the force get ‚Äúthinner‚Äù, be more ‚Äúthinly spread‚Äù, and be therefore weaker, the far you be away from it source. let's examine this in more detail by specify a physical mechanism for the gravitational force. newton didn't specify a physical mechanism in his theory of gravity beyond the concept of a physical force. but, of course, a the inventor of mathematical physic he would have assumed, and indeed speculate upon, the physical mechanism of gravity.\ ( i know a few ancient greeks, a well a galileo and kepler, do some small piece of mathematical physic before newton, but newton invent calculus with which to carry out his physics, and since calculus be the mathematics of change, and since physic be nothing but the mathematical description of how thing change with respect to time, then if physic be a body of knowledge, the physic you can do without calculus be the fingernail clipping ) however, we do know that newton believe that light be a corpuscular phenomenon, and since all the other force of our universe rely on force carry particles, it's reasonable to work with the idea of a force carry particle underlie the gravitational force. we will follow the modern convention of refer to the force carry particle of gravity a ‚Äúgravitons‚Äù. now newton‚Äôs theory be that all the mass constitute the earth be constantly emit ( and absorb ) gravitons, that is, elementary particle that carry the gravitational force. when we say that graviton ‚Äúcarry the gravitational force‚Äù, we mean that when these particle encounter any massive object, they have a physical interaction with the object that induces a force on the object, that accelerates it in the opposite direction from which the graviton arrived, which, in our example, would be towards the centre of the earth.\ ( graviton be quantum particles, but this doesn't affect our argument, it just mean the path they take between object be calculate by think of the particle a wave that relate to the probability of a give particle be found in a particular region of space during a particular region of time. ) so, now we can imagine the earth emit an exceedingly large number of graviton in all direction perpendicular to it surface. then all the graviton emit at the same time, t, ( or small increment of time, ‚àÜt ) will describe the surface of a sphere enclose the earth. and a the graviton move away from the earth, this sphere will grow large and the graviton will be spread out over a large area. this mean that the far you be away from the earth, the more spread out be the graviton that you'll encounter emanate from her, and thus, the few graviton that will interact with the mass of your body per unit mass, per unit time, which in turn, result in you experience a weaker total gravitational force act on your body. this spread out of graviton be why gravity get weaker with distance, and the spread out be proportional to the surface area of the sphere define by your distance away from the centre of the earth, which explains why we divide the gravitational force by 4œÄr\^2. the universal theory of conscious gravity since gravity be not just an objectively observe physical force, but also a subjectively experienced conscious experience, to complete our theory of gravity we need to add consciousness, and a i have show in my work on quantum mechanics, the only way of add consciousness to physic be a a fundamental, intrinsic property of all physical energy. first we state the relevant principle of conscious particle physics. i. the postulate of intrinsic consciousness: e = c, physical energy, e, be exactly equal to physical consciousness, c; all the physical energy that come into existence in the big bang event possessed, and still possesses, consciousness a an intrinsic, fundamental property. the exceedingly dense ball of physical energy create in the big bang event, at t = 0, be conscious, and have subsequently evolve into the physico-conscious universe that you form a conscious part of. ( see my essay ‚Äúthe truth about quantum mechanic and consciousness‚Äù for proof that all the basic physical energy of our universe possesses, and always have possessed, intrinsic consciousness a a fundamental property. ) therefore, ii. all physical process be also conscious processes. physical process can be experienced in two ways, objectively and subjectively. ( see my essay ‚Äúsubject, object, and the principle of the physic of consciousness‚Äù ) iii. the principle of similar forms: similar configuration of conscious energy experience within themselves similar subjective conscious experiences. similar physical process experience within themselves similar subjective conscious experiences.\ ( all of modern empirical neuroscience be evidence of the principle of similar forms;

2011,0,"my experience 90 days of consistent meditation post-breakup (never having practiced before) background: around 100 days ago, i was dumped by my girlfriend of \2.5 years. shit hurt and shit hurt even worse because i felt like i deserved to be dumped. i realized that i would have dumped me too. i was emotionally reactive, often angry, often intense, easily frustrated, and -- while always confident in myself -- genuinely dissatisfied with where i was in life. more than that, i was never present. always thinking about my career, my writing, my future. i existed in the mental equivalent of the stratosphere and thought only about my ""next steps."" i never appreciated the present, and certainly never appreciated or took account of the state of of our relationship, which was lovely until i began to take it and her for granted. i didn't consider her enough. i wasn't mindful enough, then, i don't think. during the breakup, she told me she felt alone when she was with me and she was right to feel that way. i was simply never present. combine that with being reactive (re: explosive especially in fights) and well, yeah, some capital c changes needed to be made. i've known on a deep level for years that i've needed meditation. it took some trauma to act as a catalyst for me to make the change, to build the habit, to begin to practice. i want to be as kind, compassionate, loving, empathetic, and mindful as possible. i never again want to make anyone that i'm with feel alone in my presence. so, in the absolute deepest depths of heartbreak (if you've been there, you know), i downloaded headspace and got to work building a habit, building a practice. each day, with very very very little exception, i get up, make my bed, sit at the end of it, and do a headspace guided meditation for at least 10 minutes, but more often 15-20. i'll often do a session in the middle of the day/before bed, too, depending on my schedule. here are some of the benefits/realizations i've had/noticed in the past 90-100 days: 1) a sense of awareness that frustration/anger/resistance is brewing (sitting in traffic, in a long grocery line, while my boss or father is lecturing); i call those feelings the evil brew. 1a) the ability to choose not to go down the road toward the evil brew (frustration/anger/resistance) 1b) a sense of calm, peace, and pride stemming from the fact that i have recognized the evil brew and strayed away. 2) a genuine sense of awesome wonder at the roses. i'd never stopped to smell them before. when i'm outside on a walk or drive or whatever, i occasionally myself in happy, slack-jawed awe at the beauty of this life, of being privileged to be part of this world. it is a fleeting sensation but a stunning one. if you have ever taken any psychedelics, this is \somewhat\ similar to a peaceful afterglow, but more brief, mild, and organic. i hope this doesn't seem like woo-woo bullshit. it's real, at least for me. 3) the striking similarities between love and awareness. both are always there and seem to be almost the same -- it's that ""blue sky"" feeling -- it's always there but it isn't until you look up at it that you realize how nice it is. this is a bit hard to articulate. 4) the ability to handle racing thoughts/impulses. this is similar to straying away from the evil brew. have you ever scrolled on social media/reddit/surfed the web for so long that the gears in your brain seem to gain friction and grind together?

2051,0,"""how bhagavan ramana maharshi changed my life"" - gary weber when i was in graduate school working on my ph.d. in the physical sciences, i had an insight. i saw the great turmoil, unhappiness, stress, and confusion caused by the internal narrative, the ‚Äúblah, blah‚Äù, that was never-ending and useless. i decided to see if i could end it, and free myself from its grasp. as i was raised as a devout fundamental christian in the pennsylvania appalachian coal fields, there was no ‚Äúreason‚Äù why i would have even imagined this was possible. i began looking everywhere, and reading a zen poem, a profound awakening experience happened, and then went away. however, during that experience, i saw that there were no thoughts, no suffering, and a totally different and more ‚Äútrue‚Äù reality, than my ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù reality. then i began meditating in this zen tradition and found the work of bassui, a 14th century zen monk, whose process was asking ‚Äúwhat is my own mind?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat is it that hears this sound?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat moves this hand?‚Äù, etc. soon, a book manifested from a california yoga teacher who talked about ‚Äúramana maharshi‚Äù, and his questions, which were very similar, but much more accessible, detailed and documented. investigating, i found that ramana maharshi lived while i was alive, was in videos, on bbc, in life magazine, his last pictures were by henry cartier bresson, and carl jung had written the foreword for a book covering years of direct meetings with many, many seekers. it was clear that he was highly regarded and trusted. i got the pamphlet ‚Äúwho am i?‚Äù of ramana maharshi‚Äôs first written teachings. it was a constant companion for years, along with other compilations. every day, with a 50 to 60 hr/wk job with much responsibility and travel, a wife and two children, i woke at 4 or 5 am, did an hour of yoga and then an hour of self-inquiry, typically ‚Äúwhere am i?‚Äù, or ‚Äúwho hears?‚Äù before going to work. i also asked these questions throughout my workday when getting a cup of tea, or every odd numbered hour, for a few minutes. as attachments were recognised as a major obstacle, shankara‚Äôs nirvana shatakam manifested from an unexpected source. i looked at every possible category and felt into it to see if there was attachment, and if there was, asked ‚Äúwhat has this attachment?‚Äù i also read about hunting down the ‚Äúi‚Äù, so i would feel my way into what it was that was watching the contents of the mind, and carefully explore to see if i could find its root or location. after about 25 years and 20,000 hrs of practice, i deeply, fully, totally surrendered everything, every attachment, every possession, even my life, to bhagavan so that i might know the truth. within a few days, coming down from a yoga posture i had done many times before, everything stopped‚Ä¶fears, desires, thoughts and the illusion of control and free will. as there was no ‚Äúi‚Äù, there was nothing to hold the ‚Äúother end‚Äù of these, and never had been. it was clear, as bhagavan had said that nothing, not even the smallest event was being done by ‚Äúme‚Äù, but that all that occurred was happening through this empty shell of a vehicle, as the universe/bhagavan danced it. at the time i had about 1,000 scientists and engineers, four research laboratories, and about a $250mm budget so i wondered how it would be able to do my job. when i went to work, no one even noticed. i found that i was more efficient, creative, and present in meetings and with others. surprisingly, ‚Äúmy life‚Äù went along better without ‚Äúme‚Äù in it. something was running my life that was more intelligent, powerful and more connected with ‚Äúthe world‚Äù than i was, as ‚Äúit‚Äù could arrange amazing serendipitous events with people i could never have imagined i would get to know, including several billionaires. after a few months, i left my job, and went to india to study with one of the most famous yoga teachers. then on to tiruvannamalai, staying at ramanasramam, and going to many famous places particularly the old hall, virupaksha cave and skandashram, and doing giripradakshina. i even went down to the pathala lingam in the arunachaleswar temple where ramana had sat, and watched a complete ceremony in the inner chamber of the temple with only my guide and the priests in attendance. the first night, i looked up at the hill from my room, and there were fires all over arunachala. for about four years, i told very few people what had happened, but then was gradually drawn back into research and business management in very responsible positions, and into leading a small zen group, and then giving workshops. soon a book, ‚Äúhappiness beyond thought: a practical guide to awakening‚Äù manifested, strongly based on bhagavan‚Äôs teachings, including the entirety of upadesa saram, nirvana shatakam, and some of bhagavan‚Äôs recommended verses from the bhagavad gita. this book was dedicated to ramana (who wrote the book) with his famous picture sitting cross legged facing the camera with the caption ‚Äúdedicated to ramana maharshi who found me lost and wandering in a dark forest, taught me what inquiry, love and surrender were and brought nobody home.‚Äù subsequently, folks began hearing about this unusual state of natural, persistent, ‚Äúno thoughts‚Äù that had manifested, and i was invited to participate in a ph.d. thesis on ‚Äúpersistent non-duality‚Äù, in which of the 36 selected in the study out of 500 candidates, this state was the ‚Äúbest‚Äù. this led to an fmri study at yale on experienced (roughly 10,000 hrs) meditators, who were primarily theravadan buddhists doing theravada practices, in which of the 100 studied, ‚Äúmy‚Äù state was the ‚Äúmost present‚Äù and totally unique. this state was, as bhagavan had said it must be, ‚Äúsahaj‚Äù or ‚Äúnatural‚Äù, as it was always there without any ‚Äúdoing‚Äù. this was covered in a psychology tomorrow article, ‚Äúthe neuroscience of suffering: and its end‚Äù at https://jeffwarren.org/articles/neuroscienceofsuffering/. without any ‚Äúdoer‚Äù, videos, presentations, a website, a blog, another book ‚Äúdancing beyond thought: bhagavad gita verses and dialogues on awaken‚Äù based on bhagavan‚Äôs selection of bhagavad gita verses, manifested. as bhagavan had also written this book, it was dedicated to him with the same picture and caption used in the previous book. all of my work is free in some format, as it is he who makes all this happen. this realisation has made an enormous difference in all my work. in my most recent trip to ramanasramam, i was drawn to the old hall, and virupaksha cave. in the old hall, there was a direct, and totally unexpected, unmistakable message from bhagavan. the woman sitting next to me told me later than i had ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù. in virupaksha cave, i was held ‚Äúcaptive‚Äù, virtually frozen in the right hand corner for four hours while enormous energy poured out of the area around the altar and flowed with great force into ‚Äúme‚Äù. there was no message, vision, story, blinding light, etc., just the sense of a great download being installed. after four hours, it stopped as suddenly as it had arisen, and ‚Äúi was free to go‚Äù. despite great initial resistance to sanskrit and chanting, i now chant many verses from the bhagavad gita, ribhu gita, upadesa saram, nirvana shatakam, and the gayatri (with mudras), each day, and teach them to others. serendipitously, a deep bhakti practice also emerged. as i was primarily a ‚Äújnana‚Äù practitioner, i was not drawn to it naturally, but soon bhagavan, shiva, dakshinamurti, and arunachala were the objects of a bhakti practice involving the gayatri mantra and mudras. this practice moved from ‚Äútasting the sugar‚Äù, to ‚Äúbeing the sugar‚Äù, and was very valuable. i now communicate with folks all over the world with bhagavan‚Äôs message, in many different formats and venues. many days, all that can be done is to just bow down and sometimes cry, that i was so fortunate as to have been found by bhagavan. it is difficult to imagine what life would have been like had he not shown his grace on this humble pilgrim. source: https://web.archive.org/web/20161012082633/http://www.ramanakendradelhi.org/uploadimages/pdf/pdf2114071086.pdf","""how bhagavan ramana maharshi change my life"" -

along well without ‚Äúme‚Äù in it. something be run my life that be more intelligent, powerful and more connect with ‚Äúthe world‚Äù than i was, a ‚Äúit‚Äù could arrange amaze serendipitous event with people i could never have imagine i would get to know, include several billionaires. after a few months, i left my job, and go to india to study with one of the most famous yoga teachers. then on to tiruvannamalai, stay at ramanasramam, and go to many famous place particularly the old hall, virupaksha cave and skandashram, and do giripradakshina. i even go down to the pathala lingam in the arunachaleswar temple where ramana have sat, and watch a complete ceremony in the inner chamber of the temple with only my guide and the priest in attendance. the first night, i look up at the hill from my room, and there be fire all over arunachala. for about four years, i told very few people what have happened, but then be gradually drawn back into research and business management in very responsible positions, and into lead a small zen group, and then give workshops. soon a book, ‚Äúhappiness beyond thought: a practical guide to awakening‚Äù manifested, strongly base on bhagavan‚Äôs teachings, include the entirety of upadesa saram, nirvana shatakam, and some of bhagavan‚Äôs recommend verse from the bhagavad gita. this book be dedicate to ramana (who write the book) with his famous picture sit cross legged face the camera with the caption ‚Äúdedicated to ramana maharshi who found me lose and wander in a dark forest, taught me what inquiry, love and surrender be and brought nobody home.‚Äù subsequently, folk begin hearing about this unusual state of natural, persistent, ‚Äúno thoughts‚Äù that have manifested, and i be invite to participate in a ph.d. thesis on ‚Äúpersistent non-duality‚Äù, in which of the 36 select in the study out of 500 candidates, this state be the ‚Äúbest‚Äù. this lead to an fmri study at yale on experienced (roughly 10,000 hrs) meditators, who be primarily theravadan buddhist do theravada practices, in which of the 100 studied, ‚Äúmy‚Äù state be the ‚Äúmost present‚Äù and totally unique. this state was, a bhagavan have say it must be, ‚Äúsahaj‚Äù or ‚Äúnatural‚Äù, a it be always there without any ‚Äúdoing‚Äù. this be cover in a psychology tomorrow article, ‚Äúthe neuroscience of suffering: and it end‚Äù at https://jeffwarren.org/articles/neuroscienceofsuffering/. without any ‚Äúdoer‚Äù, videos, presentations, a website, a blog, another book ‚Äúdancing beyond thought: bhagavad gita verse and dialogue on awaken‚Äù base on bhagavan‚Äôs selection of bhagavad gita verses, manifested. a bhagavan have also write this book, it be dedicate to him with the same picture and caption use in the previous book. all of my work be free in some format, a it be he who make all this happen. this realisation have make an enormous difference in all my work. in my most recent trip to ramanasramam, i be drawn to the old hall, and virupaksha cave. in the old hall, there be a direct, and totally unexpected, unmistakable message from bhagavan. the woman sit next to me told me later than i have ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù. in virupaksha cave, i be held ‚Äúcaptive‚Äù, virtually frozen in the right hand corner for four hour while enormous energy pour out of the area around the altar and flow with great force into ‚Äúme‚Äù. there be no message, vision, story, blinding light, etc., just the sense of a great download be installed. after four hours, it stop a suddenly a it have arisen, and ‚Äúi be free to go‚Äù. despite great initial resistance to sanskrit and chanting, i now chant many verse from the bhagavad gita, ribhu gita, upadesa saram, nirvana shatakam, and the gayatri (with mudras), each day, and teach them to others. serendipitously, a deep bhakti practice also emerged. a i be primarily a ‚Äújnana‚Äù practitioner, i be not drawn to it naturally, but soon bhagavan, shiva, dakshinamurti, and arunachala be the object of a bhakti practice involve the gayatri mantra and mudras. this practice move from ‚Äútasting the sugar‚Äù, to ‚Äúbeing the sugar‚Äù, and be very valuable. i now communicate with folk all over the world with bhagavan‚Äôs message, in many different format and venues. many days, all that can be do be to just bow down and sometimes cry, that i be so fortunate a to have be found by bhagavan. it be difficult to imagine what life would have be like have he not show his grace on this humble pilgrim. source:

2328,0,"if you feel stuck and are struggling to change a certain aspect of yourself, or of your life, it is likely because the approach you are using does not address your past, present and future. let me tell you why. if you feel stuck and are struggling to change a certain aspect of yourself, or of your life, it is likely because the approach you are using does not address your past, present and future. if you neglect even just one of these 3 elements, you will eventually feel stuck. let me explain what i mean by that and how by combining approaches from 3 different fields, you can have a much more complete and effective process for transformation. it all starts with the desire to change. there is something that you desire but you don‚Äôt have or something you want to see in yourself but it is not there at the moment. in essence, you build an image of yourself that is better than the present one. this image is your target, your future destination. for me it started here too. i wanted to be able to socialize, make friends and go on dates. i wanted to express myself freely with no fears, feel comfortable even in high pressure situations and have no anxiety. that was the desire that ignited the transformation process. i first came across life coaching. although i was very skeptical in the beginning, i became rapidly fascinated with it. the new ideas made a lot of sense to me and once i started trying them, the results really surprised me. i was amazed at how simple things such as changing mindsets or controlling my focus could change my inner state and make such a difference. it changed the way i understood myself and made me a much more positive person. i had a very rigid idea of who i was and suddenly that idea was shaken. i realised i could change much more than i previously thought. this brings me to the second element of time that life coaching is good at addressing: the present. once you have a destination you need to take concrete steps, a plan of action is required, and action happens in the present. life coaching is great for that. however, there is another field that also has a lot to contribute: eastern spirituality teachings. you are probably familiar with the idea of living in the present and being mindful. these ideas came to me through zen and tantra teachings and showed me that what happens in the present is more than just a step towards a destination, we must enjoy walking our path and make the most out of it. that is a way of being but should also include tools that enable you to savor pleasant emotions in their full extent and tools to allow you to deal with unpleasant feelings in a healthy way. there is one more element to talk about: the past. as i progressed in my path, i started to have difficulties overcoming deep rooted patterns and i struggled to find a tool that helped. i even tried the ‚Äúfake it until you make it‚Äù approach but it was disastrous. when it came to situations that triggered my fight or flight response, i was absolutely powerless. it was clear that deep subconscious patterns related to trauma were very difficult, or even impossible, to overcome with the approaches from life coaching that i knew. in other words, life coaching seemed to be great at addressing the future and the present, but fell short when it came to the past. usually, the furthest in the past, the more difficult a certain pattern is to address. this can be a certain behavior that you are unable to control, or it can be the way you feel in certain situations or with certain people. these are all patterns that are in your subconscious mind, that‚Äôs why you feel that you have no control over them because indeed your conscious mind cannot easily reach them. if the patterns are there as a result of trauma, it is even more difficult to change. the field of trauma therapy has the best tools to address these patterns but there are approaches from eastern teachings that are also great for this. in fact, i had great results and went through some deep healing in a 10-day meditation retreat i did years ago. no matter how important addressing the past might be, focusing exclusively on it, can be equally a mistake. people that go through therapy only sometimes complain to me. in the beginning, there is a huge moment of letting go because they are talking about things that have been suppressed for years, in some cases they are opening up for the first time. on its own, this is enough to bring a huge relief and lightness. however, it is common for people to very rapidly reach a point of ‚Äúand now what?‚Äù. this happens because this field is not specialised in the future, it is mostly about dealing with the past. this can lead people to feel a bit lost and without knowing how to proceed next. plus, they might finally identify the origin of the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù but they lack the knowhow of how to proceed in the present in a different way. there needs to be an effective way to create an alternative to the pattern of the past. so there you go, there‚Äôs the past, present and future and there is life coaching, trauma therapy and eastern spirituality teachings. all have something to offer. the 3 fields actually affect the 3 elements of time although some are better suited for some problems rather than others. in my opinion, selecting and combining tools from each field is the most effective approach because it offers the possibility to address the 3 elements of time in a systematic and harmonious way. addressing the past is about letting go of old patterns that do not serve us anymore and healing from trauma. the present is about taking concrete action and living in a mindful way. the future is about creating goals, constantly refining a vision of the life you want and the person you want to be. if you neglect even just one of these elements, you will feel stuck and encounter resistance to change. if you do not address the future, you will feel you have no direction, you are lost and purposeless. if you don‚Äôt address the present, you either do not take action, so you will not change. or you take action without a mindful approach, meaning that you take steps, but you won‚Äôt enjoy the ride. all your actions will be done for the hope of a future happiness that might never come. if you neglect the past, you will feel that you are carrying unnecessary weight, you will encounter resistance time and time again, you might see things change on the outside but inside you will still feel the same. if there is pain, you will feel pain, no matter what you accomplish. you can end up carrying the feeling of lack of self-worth, shame, or any other form of suffering your whole life. change is possible as long as you have the right tool for the job.","if you feel stuck and be struggle to change a certain aspect of yourself, or of your life, it be likely because the approach you be use do not address your past, present and future. let me

2460,0,"just looking for some tips hey everyone, i‚Äôve been on and off doing meditation during this year and more recently have been trying to make it a more consistent habit. every single time, i put on some meditation music which varies in frequency from 528hz, 417hz, 428hz, etc‚Ä¶. i choose a different frequency put that on through my headphones loud enough to block out most sounds and then i begin to just focus on my breath, just saying to myself mentally breathe in, and breath out. i have noticed that depending on sessions the results will vary from, sometimes feeling super giddy to other times feeling calm, other times it‚Äôs as if i have dropped a 20 pound weight off my mind, and sometimes i don‚Äôt notice much at all besides being slightly calmer. only negatives i‚Äôve experienced is being uncomfortable while finding a seated position, i like to do criss cross on the floor and have my hands palms open on my knees or upper thigh. the only hang up is that i find my middle/upper inside back gets super sore and tense from sitting up straight, like the inside of my shoulder blades. i have also read the book meditations made easy by preston bentley and took photos of a ton of the different types of meditation he recommended that i liked. another note is that i normally do around 10-20 minutes, i like to time myself because i eventually want to be able to do longer sessions without stopping. anyways, do any of you gurus or joe schmo‚Äôs out there have any tips or advise for me. i‚Äôd greatly appreciate it, thanks in advance good people","just look for some tip hey everyone, i‚Äôve be on and off do meditation during this year and more recently have be try to make it a more consistent habit. every single time, i put on some meditation music which varies in frequency from 528hz, 417hz, 428hz, etc‚Ä¶. i choose a different frequency put that on through my headphone loud enough to block out most sound and then i begin to just focus on my breath, just say to myself mentally breathe in, and breath out. i have notice that depend on session the result will vary from, sometimes feel super giddy to other time feel calm, other time it‚Äôs a if i have drop a 20 pound weight off my mind, and sometimes i don‚Äôt notice much at all besides be slightly calmer. only negative i‚Äôve experienced be be uncomfortable while find a seat position, i like to do criss cross on the floor and have my hand palm open on my knee or upper thigh. the only hang up be that i find my middle/upper inside back get super sore and tense from sit up straight, like the inside of my shoulder blades. i have also read the book meditation make easy by preston bentley and take photo of a ton of the different type of meditation he recommend that i liked. another note be that i normally do around 10-20 minutes, i like to time myself because i eventually want to be able to do longer session without stopping. anyways, do any of you guru or joe schmo‚Äôs out there have any tip or advise for me. i‚Äôd greatly appreciate it, thanks in advance good people","look tip hey everyone, i‚Äôve meditation year recently try consistent habit. single time, meditation music varies frequency 528hz, 417hz, 428hz, etc‚Ä¶. choose different frequency headphone loud block sound begin focus breath, mentally breathe in, breath out. notice depend session result vary from, feel super giddy time feel calm, time it‚Äôs drop 20 pound weight mind, don‚Äôt notice slightly calmer. negative i‚Äôve experienced uncomfortable seat position, like criss cross floor hand palm open knee upper thigh. hang middle/upper inside super sore tense sit straight, like inside shoulder blades. read book meditation easy preston bentley photo ton different type meditation recommend liked. note normally 10-20 minutes, like time eventually want able longer session stopping. anyways, guru joe schmo‚Äôs tip advise me. i‚Äôd greatly appreciate it, thanks advance good people"

2527,0,"has anyone ever experienced this before? see image (colors vary): https://imgur.com/i15qdne i've been experiencing and studying these for a few years. i've come to some conclusions, but i am interested in hearing if anyone else has seen these, and what your interpretations are :) edit: for clarification i am going to describe as objectively as possible my experience with these vibrant points of color, and provide some images i found made by other people which indicate to me that they also saw, or had described to them this phenomena. also, i would like to clarify that these are not visual snow or phosphenes. i am able to see visual snow as well, which is a different visual phenomena. the first time i saw these, i was sitting in a restaurant with a friend, and they were literally everywhere. i was very amused, seeing them, and utterly clueless and equally fascinated by them. as i began to study them, i took note that they are always infinitesimally small. i don't tend to see them by default, i have to actively look for and focus on them. they can be any vibrant color, although they are typically fuchsia and or green for me, and i almost never see yellow. they can change color while i am observing them, which may or may not be related to my internal state of mind (emotions?). in meditation i have seen them changing through the whole rainbow very quickly. i have never seen them as white, black, grey, or non vibrant colors like brown. they are evenly spaced, looking vaguely triangular in pattern. when seeing them against distant objects their spacing looks farther apart in comparison. when seeing them against very near objects their spacing is very tight. it is hard to tell if they change in relative size as well because of how small each point is, but they probably do. this seems to be because they are a definitite distance away from each other and do not get closer or farther away from the viewer relative to the apparent distance of material objects. they do not move at all on their own in my experience. if you look around, they move with you. there is a slight lag to their movement when you move, but that is not easily seen just by looking at these points of vibrant color because they are difficult to focus on while you are moving. in particularly deep open eye meditation, lines of equally vibrant color will connect these points in a hex-like grid. here is an illustration to give you an idea of what this looks like: https://imgur.com/l2y0v93 another thing that can be seen while in deep open eye meditation is a bit harder to find, but very amazing. while staring into a kind of middle distance, losing focus very slightly on all physical objects, staring straight ahead, you may be able to pick out alternating shades of darker and lighter patches at the top of your visual field. without physically looking upward, observe this area above your point of focus and very gently sway/strafe your body/head from side to side. if these patches of darker and lighter portions start moving left when you move right, and moving right when you move left, you've spotted it. it can be particularly difficult to see the entirety of the shape, but even seeing just this motion will help you to lock your eyes in on this bizzare translucent ""field"". the shape is like a torus, but it has a very particular shape, and is covered in what looks like ""field lines"". no matter what you have in front of you, once you have locked your eyes onto this shape, you will be able to see it through anything. thanks to this, i was able to put my phone between me and it the first time i saw it, and i quickly traced it's shape with my stylus. here is the original tracing: https://imgur.com/ebzz8wi this is a sketch i made later, trying to give a better impression of what it looked like: https://imgur.com/ozaii69 when i saw this shape for the first time, i also saw that every single point of vibrant light that i had been seeing was sitting exactly at the intersections of the field lines in this shape. i was strafing slowly back and forth still, and this shape was slightly rotating in the opposite direction to my movements. i tried moving forward and backward while looking at this structure, and became aware of a very tightly wound translucent spiral, originating at the point in the center of the shape. when i moved forward, this spiral spun clockwise. when i moved backward, the spiral reversed and went counter clockwise. when i was still, the spiral was still. then i tried merely thinking about moving forward, and the spiral spun clockwise again. i was able to get it spinning very rapidly. i have since been able to pick out multiple spirals all spinning in various directions, overlapping each other, which causes the turbulent appearance of a kind of ""static"" when not noticing the spirals. they can be easy to pick out if you see multiple rows of curving lines and follow them to the center of a given spiral. back to the structure, i noticed that the central point was perfectly level with my two open eyes. if i got up and moved around, it stayed in front of me, but there is a slight lag in it's movement, and it settles just a moment after i do. when i focused on the spaces in the structure between the field lines, they became sort of crystalline glassy, popping out a bit, and the vibrant points of color disappeared. some days or weeks after describing this structure to people, someone showed me this painting, which was very exciting to see. absolutely someone else saw or had this described to them, for this painting to exist: https://imgur.com/yrggvpk out of curiosity, i sent conscious attention to the ajna chakra location while looking at the strcuture, to see what would happen. in each ""window"" i saw a spiral of ""energy"" like a galaxy appear and then coalesce into an eye, looking back at me. this is almost perfectly represented by these two paintings i found by alex gray, although he tends to put the eyes where i see the vibrant points of light: https://imgur.com/qytnwom and https://imgur.com/tlvakci this other painting by alex gray is also very reminiscent of this shape/structure i see: https://imgur.com/5z2px38 these other images also seem related: https://imgur.com/6dmyurf and https://imgur.com/errpdpt and possibly https://imgur.com/flgswrg i would love to see the exact equation which gives rise to this torroidal shape. for reference, this is what visual snow looks like, as expressed by people who deal with it: https://c.tenor.com/9mivcgkzw70aaaac/visual-snow.gif in contrast to what i am describing, and what i have illustrated, this is in constant motion, and does not have groupings of single colors which are stationary and distanced well apart from each other. visual snow is an entirely different phenomena. this is what floaters look like:

2571,0,"feel confused on what to do when i sit to meditate (open awareness vs breath focus) i've been meditating for around 6 months now. i started out on headspace which teaches a focus on the breath specifically. however a few months ago i switched to waking up (sam harris) because i couldn't afford headspace monthly cost. what i noticed is they both teach meditation differently. waking up doesn't often talk about specific breath focus but rather a kind of ""open awareness"" where you allow all sensations, sounds, visual field and the breath. i find this open awareness helped me realise that i was trying to focus on the breath way too intensely, like ""reaching out"" for it rather than accepting it. i feel more relaxed when i do this method - but is relaxation the goal of meditation? i have a different concern with the open awareness way: i worry i'm not actually meditating due to the lack of focus. i just kind of try focus on everything all at once (breath, body, sounds, visual field) but i think it's impossible to actually take it all in at once, so what ends up happening is my attention flicks between all of these things mostly at random - is this a bad thing? is it even training a lack of focus maybe? i find now every time i sit down to meditate, i kind of switch at random between these two techniques of breath focus and open awareness, which i feel isn't good as i'm practicing 2 things at once. i'm sure these are just different techniques rather than right and wrong, but i never know which one to do. since i'm still very inexperienced at meditation, which is a better starting point? i started meditating for anxiety which i've had my whole life and is quite intense, and also ocd symptoms. i want to reduce these as much as i can, i still find meditation helpful and feel better after, but it doesn't carry on into my daily life unfortunately any advice, should i maybe alternate between these two techniques?

2707,0,"zen meditation - three step process note: this article was pulled from the japanese zen buddhism page of stanford's philosophy encyclopedia. i'm posting it because it gives a good overview of what meditation is, and the steps in the meditation process. if you are just beginning a meditation practice, it might be a worthwhile read to help fill in some knowledge gaps you may have in your picture of the process. the full article can be found at:https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/japanese-zen/thepra when one engages in zen meditation, zen recommends that its practitioner follow a three-step procedure: adjusting one‚Äôs body, breathing and mind. the practitioner follows these adjustments in the order mentioned when he or she begins. when concluding a sitting session, the procedure is reversed so that he or she can return to an everyday standpoint. we now briefly explain these three steps in the order mentioned. 3.1 the adjustment of the body generally speaking, the adjustment of the body means to prepare oneself (one‚Äôs mind-body) in such a way that one can achieve an optimal state of being free. to do so, the practitioner needs to have a proper diet, engage in appropriate physical exercise, and avoid forming habits contrary to nurturing a healthy mind-body condition. specifically, however, when zen mentions the adjustment of the body, it has in mind seated meditation postures. there are two postures which zen recognizes: the lotus-posture and the half-lotus posture. a long zen tradition takes them to be effective for stilling the mind and dissolving various psychological complexes and psychosomatic disorders. however, if a lay practitioner cannot at first assume these postures, they can be substituted initially by sitting on a chair with the spine straight, as it can bring about a similar effect. the adjustment of the body is necessary for the practitioner in order to experience the practical benefits of doing meditation. 3.2 the adjustment of breathing the benefits of zen meditation are closely tied to the practice of breathing. generally speaking, zen doesn‚Äôt recommend any complicated, strenuous breathing exercises as in yoga. zen‚Äôs breathing exercise is called ‚Äúobservation of breath count‚Äù (s≈´sokukan). in this exercise, the practitioner counts an in-coming breath and an out-going breath. before counting the breath, the practitioner breathes in through the nostrils and breathes out through the mouth a couple of times. then one starts counting breaths, but this time breathing in through the nostrils and breathing out through the nostrils. the breath count is performed while performing an abdominal breathing: one brings in air all the way down to the lower abdomen, and breathes out from there. this exercise has the effect of infusing one‚Äôs mind-body with fresh life-energy and expelling a negative toxic energy out of the practitioner‚Äôs system. for this reason, it must be done in a place where there is ample ventilation. a key to performing breathing exercises successfully is just to observe the in-coming and out-going breath. though these are simple instructions, they are difficult to execute because the neophyte tends to become distracted. present concerns, worries, fears, and past memories often surface. zen calls them ‚Äúwandering thoughts,‚Äù which refers to any mental object that prevents the practitioner from concentrating. if one wants to make progress in meditation, this is one of the first things that the practitioner must learn to overcome. we now turn to the psycho-physiological meaning of the breathing exercise. ordinarily, we breathe sixteen to seventeen times per minute, which we do unconsciously or involuntarily. this is because under ordinary circumstances, breathing is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. neurophysiologically, the center where breathing is controlled is found in the hypothalamus, in the mid-brain. the autonomic nervous system is so-called because it functions independently of our will. zen breathing is a shift from unconscious, involuntary breathing to conscious, voluntary breathing. this means that zen meditation is a way of regulating the unconscious-autonomic order of our being. psychologically, counting the breath trains the unconscious mind and neurophysiologically, it trains the involuntary activity of the nerves that control the function of the various visceral organs. here we find a reason why zen recommends abdominal breathing. nerves are bundled in the upper part of the abdominal cavity, and the abdominal breathing exercise stimulates this bundle. as it does so, parasympathetic nerves still the mind. this point is significant in learning to control emotion. ordinarily, we are told to control our emotion by exercising our will. this is, for example, what kant recommends. this method works to a certain extent, but we expend our energy unnecessarily in exercising our will. think of a situation where one tries to submerge a ball in water. when the size of the ball is relatively small, this can be accomplished with little effort. but as the size of the ball becomes larger, it becomes increasingly difficult. analogously, a lot of psychic energy is required to suppress one‚Äôs deeper emotions. there comes a time then when one can no longer hold them down. consequently, one may end up exploding in various ways, ranging from personal fits to violent social crimes. if we observe a person in an angry state, we will notice that such a person‚Äôs breathing pattern and rhythm is shallow, rough, and irregular. on the other hand, if we observe a person in a peaceful state, the breathing is deep, smooth, slow, and rhythmical. these examples show that there is a strong correlation between the pattern and the rhythm of breathing and a person‚Äôs emotional state, or more generally, state of mind. zen breathing has a way of naturally heightening the positive correlation between the activity of the autonomic nervous system and emotion. neurophysiologically, it happens that the center where breathing is regulated and the region where emotion is generated coincide. this means that the conscious breathing psychologically affects the pattern of how one generates emotion, and at the same time it also has a neurophysiological effect on how the autonomous activity of the unconscious is regulated. we will now move on to the third step involved in meditation. 3.3 the adjustment of the mind once the bodily posture and the breathing are adjusted, the practitioner next learns to adjust the mind. this means that the practitioner consciously moves to enter a state of meditation. in so doing, the practitioner learns to disengage him- or herself from the concerns of daily life. that is to say, one tries to stop the operation of the conscious mind. however, if one tries to stop the mind by using one‚Äôs mind, the mind which is trying to stop itself is still operative. in other words, it is practically impossible to stop the mind by using the mind. instead, zen tries to accomplish this by the immobile bodily posture and the breathing exercise. in this connection, it will be informative to know how the practitioner experiences breathing as he or she deepens meditation. we can identify three basic stages: initially the practitioner can hear the audible sound of the in-coming and out-going breaths. this is rough and ‚Äúgross‚Äù breathing. this is followed by the second stage in which he or she can feel the pathway of the in-coming and out-going breaths. breathing at this point becomes ‚Äúsubtle‚Äù in that there will no longer be audible sound of the breaths but simply a stream of life-energy. in the third stage there is no more feeling of the in-coming and out-going breaths. when this occurs, the practitioner can settle into a deeper meditational state. also, it is significant to note that as the practitioner enters a deeper state of meditation, the interval between inhalation and exhalation is prolonged, i.e., the retention of breath is prolonged, as the reduction of breathing activities occurs. meditation trains one to sit face-to-face with one‚Äôs self, while creating a psychological isolation from the external world. with this, one enters into an internal world of psychƒì. as the practitioner attempts to enter the world of psychƒì, various things start surfacing in the field of the practitioner‚Äôs meditative awareness. these are mostly things of concern that have occupied the practitioner in the history of his or her life, or things the practitioner has consciously suppressed for various reasons. initially, the practitioner experiences recent desires, anxieties, concerns, ideas, and images that have surfaced in his or her daily life. a psychological reason that the practitioner experiences these various things is due in part to the fact the practitioner has lowered the level of conscious activity, by assuming the meditation posture, and doing the breathing exercise. this mechanism is the same as when one has a dream at night. when the level of consciousness is lowered, the suppressive power of ego-consciousness weakens, and consequently the autonomous activity of the unconscious begins to surface. however, these desires, images and ideas are distractions insofar as meditation is concerned. this is because in meditation you must learn to focus your awareness on one thing. one must learn just to observe without getting involved in them. that is, one must learn to dis-identify oneself with them. in the process of deepening meditation, one can roughly identify three distinct stages: the stage of concentration, the stage of meditation, and the stage of absorption. in the stage of concentration, the practitioner concentrates, for example on the lower abdomen, establishing a dualistic relationship between the practitioner who is concentrating and the lower abdomen that is the focus of concentration. this dualistic relationship is broken gradually as the practitioner moves into the stage of meditation. the activity of the ego-consciousness is gradually lessened, and the barriers it sets up for itself are gradually removed. when the practitioner enters the stage of absorption (samƒÅdhi), the dualistic framing of the mind will be removed such that the mind starts structuring itself non-dualistically. there will be no separation or distancing between an object of the mind and the activity of the mind itself. as the practitioner repeats this process over a long period of time, he or she will come to experience a state in which no-thing appears. zen uses the phrase ‚Äúno-mind‚Äù to designate this state. no-mind does not mean a mindless state. nor does it mean that there is no mind. it means that there is no conscious activity of the mind that is associated with ego-consciousness in the everyday standpoint. in other word, no-mind is a free mind that is not delimited by ideas, desires, and images. no-mind is a state of mind in which there is neither a superimposition of ideas nor a psychological projection. that is, no-mind is a practical transcendence from the everyday mind, without departing from the everydayness of the world.","zen meditation - three step process note: this article be pull from the japanese

some insights i've come to regarding meditation and its impact on my adhd. i thought mindfulness and meditation would be my panacea for adhd. however, as is expected, this was not the case. thankfully through bouts of therapy, various medications, and meditation i have grown to understand myself and my relationship to this disorder in very interesting ways. what i find most striking is the difference between meditating on medication versus off medication. for years people talked about the tranquility practice can bring and for years i felt i was constantly lost thought. i may taste it for a brief moment and then in the next to be completed entranced by a web of thought. i left long sessions (30 mins) feeling mentally drained, constantly pulling my attention back to the present moment. with medication, i find these moments of tranquility last far longer. detaching from thoughts takes minimal effort compared to what felt like a herculean act previously. the impulse to chase an emotion, or fixate on a distraction, all of it lowered to levels that finally felt manageable. beyond these practical benefits, it is the insights into the nature of my mind which i find truly fascinating. to observe my mind both medicated and unmedicated, i see clearly how powerless i am in controlling what actually enters my awareness. for so long i fought to change the endless chatter in my head as if pure willpower could rewire an entire disorder. recognizing these stark differences has allowed me to simply focus on my reactions to the chatter. i have also grown a great appreciation for myself, admiration that despite a constant barrage of impulses and distractions i am still able to direct my attention and live a life i find meaningful. it has finally allowed me to be kind and patient with myself, to let go of judgments and conclusions that failed to take the totality of who i am into perspective. in sum, i feel medication gave me the opportunity to quiet my mind so that

2736,0,"zen or vipassana meditation? hi everyone! i am (kinda) new to meditation. actually, a few months ago, i tried learning meditation with a teacher (it was basically every morning, an online class). i think it was a form of vipassana meditation, but it would vary a lot. because of money reasons (i'm a student), but also because i did not like my teacher a lot, i stopped. later on, my therapist started stressing the importance of mindfulness with regards to some of the problems we were discussing. i started using the app waking up, and i generally enjoy it, but feel like i'm mainly doing vipassana breath meditations and i can now do it by myself without being guided by the app. to broaden my understanding, i started reading mindfulness in plain english, which i'm enjoying a lot. however, they make it clear how important it will be to have, at a certain point down the road, a teacher to deepen your practice. a real teacher. as i said, because of money, i can't afford expensive courses, and because i'm studying a lot i can't travel for more than 20/30 minutes from my house or university to reach a temple or whichever other place to practice. i found close to my house a very nice temple where they, however, practice zen meditation and not vipassana. it should also be free/very much inexpensive. it is however a meditation practice different from the one i've been learning. i now wonder what i should do, since it feels like a stupid choice to keep practicing vipassana if eventually my teacher could be doing zen meditation. i don't even really understand the difference. do you have any suggestions?","zen or vipassana meditation? hi everyone! i be (kinda) new to meditation. actually, a few month ago, i try learn meditation with a teacher (it be basically every morning, an online class). i think it be a form of vipassana meditation, but it would vary a lot. because of money reason (i'm a student), but also because i do not like my teacher a lot, i stopped. later on, my therapist start stress the importance of mindfulness with regard to some of the problem we be discussing. i start use the app wake up, and i generally enjoy it, but feel like i'm mainly do vipassana breath meditation and i can now do it by myself without be guide by the app. to broaden my understanding, i start reading mindfulness in plain english, which i'm enjoy a lot. however, they make it clear how important it will be to have, at a certain point down the road, a teacher to deepen your practice. a real teacher. a i said, because of money, i can't afford expensive courses, and because i'm study a lot i can't travel for more than 20/30 minute from my house or university to reach a temple or whichever other place to practice. i found close to my house a very nice temple where they, however, practice zen meditation and not vipassana. it should also be free/very much inexpensive. it be however a meditation practice different from the one i've be learning. i now wonder what i should do, since it feel like a stupid choice to keep practice vipassana if eventually my teacher could be do zen meditation. i don't even really understand the difference. do you have any suggestions?","zen vipassana meditation? hi everyone!

2910,0,"reflections from a soundscape meditation i recently tried a  with a group. the method in short is to start off listening to the sounds of your own breath as you would with a normal meditation, and then progressively increase the breadth of your awareness by moving that listening barrier outwards from your self. as a group exercise, we then came back together to see what common experiences we shared in listening to the sounds of the area we had inhabited together. we all heard the dry leaves scrape against the ground near where we were sitting. we highlighted the slow, building sound of the wind rushing between the trees, and the sensation when that gust finally blew past where we were. the aim of this exercise was to create an  experience amongst each other, and in that we succeeded. during the meditation however, my mind had wandered towards the clock. prior to beginning, i had set a timer on my phone as one does so that i knew when to wrap up the meditation and return to the group. late in the meditation, enough time felt to have gone by that i wondered if i‚Äôd started the timer at all. while it was technically a group exercise, we were seated far enough apart in the environment that one‚Äôs individual rustlings or noises wouldn‚Äôt disturb another‚Äôs. for a few moments, i felt the anxiety of both not knowing if i‚Äôd set the timer, and not wanting to exit the meditation to check and disrupt my flow. as i attempted to veer from this anxiety and back into some semblance of a blissful state of awareness, i came to the following highdea‚Äîhigh on life, no ‚Äòganja necessary. this situation i was experiencing was a metaphor for the waking experience of everyone around us. i was waiting, waiting, waiting, trying to achieve‚Äîsomething‚Äîand yet the something that i was waiting to achieve was actually just the end of what i should have been focussing on achieving. i heard a metaphor once that meditating is like dancing. the point isn‚Äôt to achieve anything at all, the point is to dance. so it goes with life. as i came to the conclusion that that damn rectangle in my pocket wasn‚Äôt a signal of completing an achievement, but rather an interruption to what i was achieving, my anxiety at having not set the timer began to wane. i fell back into bliss. if i run over our allotted time, then someone will come and get ben‚Äîi thought‚Äîbut until then, i‚Äôm going to enjoy this moment, free of distraction and anxiety for when it may come to an end. bzzz, bzzz, bzzz. ‚Ä¶less than 10 seconds thereafter. the achievement you should cherish is the one that you are currently in the process of achieving. recognize each moment for the achievement that it is and maybe you‚Äôll find a little more peace in your lived experience.

2925,0,"ocd after six months of daily meditation i commented this on another post but i wanted to give it its own post as this is the kind of thing i was looking for 6 months ago. i had hit a wall with my ability to cope with my ocd - meds hadn‚Äôt worked and i knew why everything was happening but the scale of my constant distress‚Ä¶ i couldn‚Äôt get a hold of it. so my wife bought me an eckhart tolle book and i looked into meditation, seriously. and it has, no bit, been the path to acceptance and freedom for me. for others with ocd (particularly pure o) i wanted to detail how and why: i have ocd (pure) which i developed 2.5 years ago ‚Äì reached a point 6 months ago when i was sick of just coping (aka i wasn't having spikes that spawned into panic attacks daily, only weekly) and knew something else had to change. i've been meditating daily since and it's truly, sincerely helped. i'm not just coping, i'm recovering. my ocd is not gone by any stretch, i have thoughts every day and i will get caught in panics but they are far less frequent. if it helps this is what it does for me and how i approach it. - i see meditation as a daily reminder to practice cbt/act/erp, whichever therapeutic process works for your particular fixations. mine are existential or sexuality/relationship focused, and all i want is for them to stop and to trust myself again. as you know if you have ocd the force of the desire for them to stop only makes it worse. when i meditate i practice accepting the thoughts without engaging with them (my compulsion being to try and rationalise with a thought: prove a memory didn't happen, test my response to an imagined situation, repeatedly visualise things to check how i feel etc). practicing this daily is the best thing i've done for myself. and when i told my therapist about this rationalisation she agreed, which always helps. - i find affirmations too cluttering for my brain and i tend to argue back against them. i just do meditations where you focus on the breath and allow thoughts to pass by. it's incredibly hard i've never managed to focus on the breath for more than maybe 45 seconds at a time, but the distance it gives you from your thoughts is so valuable. - i also like a body scan in the evening to practice focus and letting thoughts pass by, and occasionally a progressive muscle relaxation if i'm storing a lot of tension in my body. - doing a daily practice, as well as writing notes (is this past, present or future focused, what is the theme etc) when i feel a flare up coming, has helped me recognise patterns in my thinking. and when i see it is a pattern i can accept this particular flare up as an echo of some time before. there's a really great talk on insight timer by roxanne pigeon about ocd and the present moment that helped me frame this in a way that is useful: the thoughts are like your past anxieties (real or imagined) throwing rocks at you. - at first you will question the process. is it working am i doing it wrong why can't i find peace etc. in my experience it takes much longer for meditation to help outside of meditation if you have ocd. i had good days and terrible days but i was at a point where i knew i had to stick at it. our brains have patterns that are entrenched in panic and the unlearning is so so hard. but i promise you it is possible. slowly the painful steel wool that expands in your brain every time you have a thought softens and reduces. i have gone a whole afternoon without thinking about ocd at all now, let alone having thoughts affect me. when i realised i cried with relief. if you‚Äôre looking into it i‚Äôd advise starting with small practices a day ( i do mine in the mornings) and with ones that focus on anxiety if you can imo. they are not specifically for us but they better fit the way our brains function. i personally have done the headspace 'managing anxiety' course about 4 times now because it has no spiritual stuff in it (a trigger for me) but speaks directly to how anxiety manifests even if it doesn't really deal with intrusive thoughts or compulsions. i also like insight timer in the evenings ‚Äì for body scans, progressive muscle relaxation, and also talks about how obsessive thinking works can be really soothing. i recommend roxanne pigeon's ones on escaping the prison of your mind. if you‚Äôre here because you did what i did earlier this year (frantically google ocd meditation help etc) know that you are not alone in this!

2952,0,"rational justification of the self all reasoning is done in objective terms: to persuade another or ourselves of an objective, universal truth, or else a pragmatic, localized one. every thought regarding the self works within this realm of reason, and therefore every identification within the mind is an externalized attempt to justify our existence. the ego is the false self held together by the reasoning mind. identifications are with concepts: rational arguments which attempt to provide the self with universal, objective, unalienable truth and stability. we want to exist untouchable, and so when we feel that the reasoning for our existence is insufficient or based on shaky ground, we begin our work on constructing more true and stable self-concepts. but the self, who we truly are beneath this process, requires no argument for its constant, clear, and inalienable existence. yet living in this social world, we are burdened with this task of proving to one another that we are valid persons. if we do not give a convincing argument, our identity is dismissed. we can choose to give into this criticism and struggle for external validation of the self, always refining our self concept toward a greater seeming harmony with the hopes we will finally achieve objective grounds for universal social acceptance, or perhaps identifying with our denied flaws out of spite and spiraling into disharmony. both of these choices are insufficient and wholly miss the mark. as we attempt to further refine the ego as valid and true, we attach our self-sense to ever-complex conceptions which forever must be defended from collapse. flaws are discovered, and fearing the despair of an empty self (i.e. death), are corrected and fixed toward something more stable. flaws however, are ever-present in the rational self. our disharmonies coexist with our harmonies, and to the extent we deny the realities of these disharmonies from the ego-self, we deny them consciousness and push them into the periphery of our existence. this is the subconscious, the shadow, and in moments of weakness, where we feel we can no longer keep up with the authority of our ego towards maintaining harmony, we may identify with this shadow self out of spite for the ego's authoritarian rule. we deny the righteousness of harmony as pretentious and moralizing, and double down on disharmony in rebellion. the seemingly ever-present existence of disharmony, the truth of harmony always decaying into disharmony, the fact of death at the end of this life, and our orientation towards it, gives this ego a sense of truth and stability. neither paths are sufficient because each denies the reality of the other. identification with disharmony destabilizes an identification with harmony, and vice-versa. though both forces are within us, always at play, all of the time, and identification with one over the other -valuation of one over the other- is what divides the whole of our being into fragmented and disowned parts; conscious and unconscious, self and other. we do not destroy dissonance by becoming unconscious of it: it merely serves to blind us. the very act of denying disharmony puts us in a constant state of disharmony (anxiety). this is the ego process as we experience it, and without this process there is no ego. this process is rendered irrelevant by the recognition that the self is not dependant on harmony over dissonance, social acceptance over non-acceptance, truth over non-truth, perfection over flaw, etc. there is not a single reason that gives our being more reality than another, a single thought, action, or object. all are seen and can be seen by the true self which is limited by nothing, depends on nothing for it's existence. this self does not need to be argued for, it does not need to be accepted by another, it is not harmony as opposed to dissonance, as then it would depend on dissonance for its existence. this is not the case; no object to be seen gives the seer its existence. all objects of form/nature depend on opposites for their existence, i.e. harmony and disharmony, and the ego is yet another object. we are not that. we are consciousness which depends on nothing for its being. abide in this and be free from the anxiety of chasing yourself in external objects which cannot contain you. you know who you are, and now the objects you thought were you simply come and go like the tides. this has been the secret goal all along, and in this recognition itself you see that the journey has ended.","rational justification of the self all reason be do in objective terms: to persuade another or ourselves of an objective, universal truth, or else a pragmatic, localize one. every thought regard the self work within this realm of reason, and therefore every identification within the mind be an externalize attempt to justify our existence. the ego be the false self held together by the reason mind. identification be with concepts: rational argument which attempt to provide the self with universal, objective, unalienable truth and stability. we want to exist untouchable, and so when we feel that the reason for our existence be insufficient or base on shaky ground, we begin our work on construct more true and stable self-concepts. but the self, who we truly be beneath this process, require no argument for it constant, clear, and inalienable existence. yet living in this social world, we be burden with this task of prove to one another that we be valid persons. if we do not give a convincing argument, our identity be dismissed. we can choose to give into this criticism and struggle for external validation of the self, always refining our self concept toward a great seem harmony with the hope we will finally achieve objective ground for universal social acceptance, or perhaps identify with our deny flaw out of spite and spiral into disharmony. both of these choice be insufficient and wholly miss the mark. a we attempt to far refine the ego a valid and true, we attach our self-sense to ever-complex conception which forever must be defend from collapse. flaw be discovered, and fear the despair of an empty self (i.e. death), be correct and fix toward something more stable. flaw however, be ever-present in the rational self. our disharmony coexist with our harmonies, and to the extent we deny the reality of these disharmony from the ego-self, we deny them consciousness and push them into the periphery of our existence. this be the subconscious, the shadow, and in moment of weakness, where we feel we can no longer keep up with the authority of our ego towards maintain harmony, we may identify with this shadow self out of spite for the ego's authoritarian rule. we deny the righteousness of harmony a pretentious and moralizing, and double down on disharmony in rebellion. the seemingly ever-present existence of disharmony, the truth of harmony always decay into disharmony, the fact of death at the end of this life, and our orientation towards it, give this ego a sense of truth and stability. neither path be sufficient because each denies the reality of the other. identification with disharmony destabilizes an identification with harmony, and vice-versa. though both force be within us, always at play, all of the time, and identification with one over the other -valuation of one over the other- be what divide the whole of our be into fragment and disown parts;
